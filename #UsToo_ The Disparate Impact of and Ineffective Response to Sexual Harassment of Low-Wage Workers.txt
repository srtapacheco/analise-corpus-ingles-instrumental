#UsToo: THE DISPARATE IMPACT
OF AND INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE
TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT
OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS
Marissa Ditkowsky*
Abstract
“A guest placed a tip on the counter, then stated he wanted to ‘put
the tip on my ass.’ I refused and he took the tip back. I was going to
tell management, but I didn’t because if he was going to be able to
come back, what would stop him from aggressive acts in the future?
He looked like he didn’t care about life.” This casino cocktail server’s disturbing account is one of many that UNITE HERE Local
1 collected in its groundbreaking study on sexual harassment and
Chicago-area casino and hotel workers’ experiences in the workplace. A hotel housekeeper recalled her experience, saying, “[The
guest] was completely naked, standing between the bed and the
desk. He asked me for shampoo. I had to jump over the beds in
order to get to the door and leave the room.”
On October 5, 2017, the New York Times broke the pivotal story that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein had covered
up nearly three decades of accusations of sexual harassment and
unwanted physical contact. Following the coverage, women around
the world became empowered to tell their stories on social media,
contributing to the #MeToo trend. Stories about sexual harassment
and the use of nondisclosure agreements also fueled the movement.
However, there was one common denominator among all the individual stories that received considerable press attention: these
women are all affluent celebrities.
Low-wage workers continue to face widespread harassment
in the workplace, yet we constantly overlook these workers’ plight.
Despite #MeToo’s impact on white-collar employees and their ability to speak up for themselves, low-income workers do not benefit
from the same protections that come with sheer bargaining power.

Rosser of the American University Washington College of Law, who supervised

That is why it is so vitally important for the law to step in and protect these workers. Low-wage workers are organizing, but lawyers
must work as allies to empower them. This piece is intended to
serve as a reminder that there is a disparity between whom the law
is intended to protect and whom the law protects in practice, as well
as to provide suggestions as to how we might work to address these
disparities.
The legal profession must take action to protect all workers—
not simply those who are affluent enough to take large financial
risks, afford the most prestigious attorneys, or singlehandedly start
a trend. Title VII, on its own, simply does not cut it. In this Article,
I argue that the largest barriers to justice and prevention of sexual
harassment for low-wage workers include (1) terms of employment
and contractual barriers, (2) lack of protection, (3) status barriers,
and (4) access to justice concerns.

all the individual stories that received considerable press attention:
these women were all affluent celebrities.
Celebrities attempted a short-lived push to raise the voices of
low-wage workers; after Alianza Nacional de Campesinas’ Monica
Ramirez wrote a letter on behalf of farmworker women in solidarity, she and other activists were invited to walk the red carpet at the
Golden Globes.7 However, since that time, interest has decreased
in the plight of low-wage workers, particularly those of women of
color, undocumented workers, and other marginalized groups.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination of employees on several protected bases, including sex.8 It also
prohibits retaliation for reporting discrimination on any protected bases.9 Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson further established that
unwelcome sexual behavior that creates a hostile work environment
constitutes employment discrimination based on sex under Title
VII, expanding Title VII’s reach beyond quid pro quo harassment.10
Many states and jurisdictions also have workplace antidiscrimination statutes that may even be more expansive in their reach than
federal protections. For example, the District of Columbia Human
Rights Law holds employers responsible for acting either wholly
or partially for discriminatory reasons; and supervisors can be held
responsible simply for aiding and abetting discrimination.11 It also
explicitly protects employees from discrimination based on sexual
orientation and gender identity.12
Despite the existence of protections for workers against sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation for reporting such
discrimination, these behaviors continue to occur. In particular, service industry workers face severe and pervasive workplace
harassment that has largely gone unaddressed.13 Their status in

the service industry leaves them more vulnerable to harassment by
customers,14 as well as by coworkers, owners, managers, and supervisors, who exploit the uneven power dynamic.15 Women in tipped
occupations generally, and especially workers in states where the
subminimum wage for those workers is not higher than $2.13
per hour, are more likely to experience harassment, indicating a
troubling devaluation of women based upon their wages and socioeconomic status.16
The divide between whom the law is intended to protect and
whom the law protects in practice is not a new concept, particularly when discussing sex-based discrimination. In Roe v. Wade, the
Supreme Court held that individuals had a constitutional privacy right to seek abortion within the first trimester of pregnancy.17
However, the Court continued to permit state-imposed restrictions on access to abortion so long as they did not, in the Court’s
perspective, impose an “undue burden” on the right.18 Additionally, following an Equal Protection Clause challenge to the Hyde
Amendment,19 the Court held that federally-funded medical insurance did not have to provide funding for abortions because the
Court refused to consider poverty alone a suspect classification.20
In reality, these restrictions have less of an effect on wealthy individuals who can bear children; this case law effectively outlawed
a guest’s harassment said they knew someone who reported the harassment
and nothing changed).

abortion for poorer individuals who rely on Medicaid.21 And yet,
despite the struggle of poorer individuals to access reproductive
health care, the narrative continues to focus on Roe v. Wade and
whether it will remain intact.22 Public discourse is simply not in
touch with the needs of low-income women and the barriers they
regularly face.23 Congress and the Supreme Court also persistently demonstrate that they do not understand the plight of the poor
and fail to adequately address their needs. As Justice Thurgood
Marshall noted in his United States v. Kras dissent on the issue of
whether one could be charged a fee to initiate a bankruptcy proceeding, “[i]t is perfectly proper for judges to disagree about what
the Constitution requires. But it is disgraceful for an interpretation
of the Constitution to be premised upon unfounded assumptions
about how people live.”24 The same deficiencies have applied, thus

far, to enforcement against sexual harassment in the workplace.
Simply put, despite #MeToo’s impact on white collar employees
and their ability to speak up for themselves, low-income workers
do not benefit from the same protections that come with sheer bargaining power. That is why it is so vitally important for the law to
step in and protect these workers.
This Article argues that the largest barriers to justice and
prevention of sexual harassment for low-wage workers include
(1) terms of employment and contractual barriers, including nondisclosure agreements and mandatory arbitration clauses; (2) lack
of protection, including in terms of classification, retaliation, certain
domestic and farmworkers, and attacks on unions and the power of
collective bargaining; (3) status barriers, including immigration status; and (4) access to justice concerns, including lack of guaranteed
civil representation, a lack of diversity on the bench, and struggles
to subject claims to a jury of the plaintiff’s peers. This list is not
meant to serve as a definitive list of every legal or situational barrier that affects the rights of low-income working women; it is simply
meant to serve as an introduction to the various types of issues that
these women might face in accessing justice or their rights. Next,
this Article addresses what legal or policy changes might remedy these issues, as well as the potential role of concerted activity.
Finally, this Article concludes that, although the manner in which
courts interpret the law matters from a workers’ rights perspective,
the solution for many of these blatant issues goes far beyond the
courts: it also extends to our legislation, policies, and societal norms.

Terms of Employment and Contractual Barriers

A.

Mandatory Individual Arbitration Clauses

Predispute mandatory arbitration clauses in employment
contracts continue to prevent low-wage workers from holding
employers accountable for the sexual harassment they experience
in the workplace.25 Although questions about the fundamental
fairness of mandatory binding arbitration are not new, the #MeToo
movement has highlighted the impact of mandatory binding arbitration agreements that require employees to waive their right to
file harassment and discrimination claims in court and potentially

as a class.26 In particular, the recent Supreme Court decision in
Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis casts serious doubts regarding
whether there is a judicial remedy to the seemingly unjust nature
of signing mandatory binding arbitration agreements as a condition of employment.27 According to a study by the Economic Policy
Institute, more than 55 percent of workers are subject to mandatory binding arbitration clauses.28 This Subpart will describe case
law and statutes surrounding individual arbitration agreements
and their disparate impact on low-wage workers in cases of sexual
harassment.
Arbitration is a process in which a private entity, as opposed
to a judge, resolves a dispute.29 Binding arbitration means that the
decision made by the arbitrator is final and enforceable.30 If a binding arbitration agreement is mandatory, the parties are required to
submit all disputes to arbitration as the exclusive remedy.31 Due
to consistent enforcement of binding arbitration agreements and
results, employers continue to incorporate predispute mandatory
binding arbitration clauses in employment contracts.32 This practice forces all employees to waive their right to access the courts in
order to be employed. In that sense, low-wage workers are denied a
jury of their peers, which might include individuals of more diverse
backgrounds than one single arbitrator. Even if an employee simply sought a bench trial, arbitrators need not be lawyers and are not

always bound by governing law, unlike a judge.33 Low-wage workers in particular also might not be aware of the circumstances under
which they might challenge an arbitration agreement due to lack of
knowledge or representation.
In addition to waiving their rights to a trial by jury, these workers also essentially waive their National Labor Relations Act right
to concerted activity via a legal suit and Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) right to collective action.34 If such an agreement requires
individual arbitration, it is impossible to bring any sort of class
action.35 These restrictions disparately affect low-wage workers,
who might wield more power as a collective. Additionally, a single
award for a low-wage worker is unlikely to be lucrative enough to
attract the representation that a class award might attract.36 Therefore, individual mandatory arbitration clauses are particularly
dangerous for low-wage workers. Although employers might argue
that arbitration is a less formal setting in which low-wage workers
would not require an attorney, the American Arbitration Association still recommends that parties seek advice of legal counsel,
particularly in cases involving discrimination.37
Employers also attempt to require postdispute arbitration. In
these situations, an employee and employer must voluntarily agree
after the rise of a dispute to send a matter to arbitration. However, due to the limited bargaining power, lack of representation,
and lack of knowledge among low-wage employees in particular,
it is doubtful whether post-dispute arbitration is truly voluntary, as
well as whether the employee actually provides informed consent
in such cases.

thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the
refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy
arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as
exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.38

The Supreme Court has interpreted this savings clause to permit only generally applicable contract defenses, and not “defenses
that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the
fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.”39
The Federal Arbitration Act states, “nothing herein contained
shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate
commerce.”40 However, the Supreme Court has interpreted this
exemption narrowly to apply only to transportation workers.41
The Court has consistently upheld the enforcement of
mandatory binding arbitration contracts in employment,42 consumer disputes, and other realms.43 The Court has interpreted the
Federal Arbitration Act to be a “liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.”44 In Epic Systems, the Court further solidified this stance.
Although Congress is free to amend the statute, the Court refused

agreements. Even though mandatory binding arbitration agreements prevent
an employee from bringing an individual suit, and might bar collective action,

to substitute its own judgement for that of Congress.45 In its opinion, the Court noted that Congress has also proven that it knows
how to override the Federal Arbitration Act should it so choose.46
The Court has also consistently endorsed the view that only generally applicable contractual arguments can be made to invalidate a
binding arbitration agreement.47 However, the Court has dependably rejected all unconscionability and public policy arguments,
as well as arguments that arbitration, in certain instances, would
breach federal law, claiming that these attacks are based solely on
the very nature of the arbitration agreement in violation of the Federal Arbitration Act.48
In Epic Systems, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent
addresses the fact that the business community sought legislation
that would allow merchants to enter into binding arbitration agreements due to court backlog.49 However, such a law would enable
merchants of relatively equal bargaining power to arbitrate commercial disputes.50 Justice Ginsburg contends that the statute was
never intended to apply to employment agreements, as evidenced
by both the legislative history and employment exemption in the
text.51 Justice Elena Kagan addressed similar concerns in American Express Company v. Italian Colors Restaurant, a case involving
a small business that signed a mandatory binding arbitration agreement with American Express; Justice Kagan writes in her dissent
that an arbitration agreement should not be enforced if it simply
allows a company or individual to contravene federal law or liability.52 This line of thinking could also be applied to employers.

Arguments for and Against Mandatory Binding
Arbitration

There are several benefits for both employers and employees
to enter into arbitration agreements. Litigation is expensive and
slow, which poses an issue for both an employer and employee.53
Using arbitration prevents further court backlog and is more informal.54 Arbitration is a private venture, which attracts less publicity.55
Less publicity could benefit both an employer and an employee—
particularly a low-wage worker that might have less recourse in
attempting to find another job should information about her experiences of complaint be revealed to other employers. Arbitration
prevents abuse of the use of class actions, which often yield unfair
settlements that primarily enrich lawyers.56 Finally, arbitration utilizes experienced decision makers who could be experts in the field
in question, whereas a traditional court would likely use a jury comprised of jury members who lack expertise, although they are likely
well intentioned.57 For low-wage workers in particular, a jury is
often not comprised of one’s peers due to economic barriers and
dismissal of jurors of one’s race due to potential “bias.”
There are also a number of negative aspects to including an
arbitration agreement in an employment contract. Arbitration is a
private venture that attracts less publicity. Many of these cases are
arbitrated with no public record of what occurred or what resulted.58 There is also little to no government oversight, which persists
despite evidence of biases in the process.59 In using arbitration,
employers also often select the arbitrator they prefer to use; in
that way, employers essentially rig the system, not only in choice of
venue, but also in that they are providing repeat business to arbitrators, who are therefore incentivized to find more favorably for the
employer.60 In a 2007 study, Public Citizen found that the National Arbitration Forum ruled for companies 94 percent of the time

in the consumer context in a sample of nearly 19,300 California
cases.61 Arbitration agreements also often specify which arbitrator
will be used.62 Therefore, not only are employees devoid of choice
in the arbitration process, but they are also devoid of the choice of
venue, which would exist if the employee were to file a lawsuit.63
For low-wage workers, venue makes a difference for several reasons. For one, travel might be too expensive. Second, the judge’s,
as well as the likely jury’s, race, life experiences, and understanding
might be dependent upon geography or district. Third, they might
be limited in terms of representation; and if they rely on legal aid, it
might be difficult to find any representation to accompany them to
a venue that is not local, or to arbitration period.
In regard to the argument that jury members lack expertise,
not every judicial case need involve a jury; in cases in which a party
does not demand a jury trial, a bench trial may still occur.64 In such
a case, jury members without expertise would not be making the
decisions. Additionally, the judge would be bound within reason
by precedent, the rules of evidence, and certain rules of procedure
to which arbitrators are not bound. However, even if a bench trial
does not occur, a right to trial by jury in criminal cases was important enough to include in the Bill of Rights, despite its potential
drawbacks.65 The idea behind a trial by jury is that (1) it would not
be solely up to one individual how the case is decided; and (2) a
jury of one’s peers is, arguably, more in tune with the realities and
effects of the case. A jury of one’s peers is vital to prevent implicit bias from dictating the decision of one individual arbitrator—or
even judge.66 In cases of mandatory binding arbitration, low-wage
workers are denied their right to a trial by jury, which would ideally be filled with a jury that actually might understand the workers’
experiences.

Arbitration clauses are being used to shield companies from
class actions and liability generally.67 Arbitration agreements are
often individual, meaning the employee must bring any claims to
individual arbitration.68 That means employees cannot take collective action or file a claim together.69 A clear depiction of the effect
of Epic Systems can be seen in the Eastern District of Michigan case
Williams v. FCA US LLC, in which African American Fiat-Chrysler employees tried to file a class action claim regarding the routine
racial discrimination in employee hiring and promotion process.70
Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit held against the employees, and they
were forced to individually arbitrate their claims.71 When companies shield themselves from class actions, they also prevent some
individual claims because the actions become less lucrative as the
potential for damages decreases, particularly in actions involving
low-wage workers.
Although arbitration proponents cite cost savings, speed, and
efficiency, in reality the cost saving is minimal since arbitrators typically charge between $750 and $1,200 per day and hearings often
experience delays in scheduling.72 Finally, employees, especially
low-wage workers, do not always understand these clauses or the
rights they are surrendering, nor do they always have a choice to
simply find employment elsewhere, particularly if all competitors
are using the same clauses.73
3.

Generally Applicable Contract Defenses

To form a valid contract, there must be mutual assent to
the terms of the contract and consideration.74 Typical affirmative
defenses to breach of contract are either based on a party’s inability
to assent (based on minority, lack of capacity, physical or economic duress, undue influence) or a fatal defect in the contract itself

(impossibility or impracticability, misrepresentation, illegality, nondisclosures, or unconscionability).75 Public policy arguments might
also be made.76 The most relevant affirmative defenses in regard
to binding arbitration are duress, illegality, and unconscionability.
In addition, lack of mutual assent and consideration can be cited,
meaning a contract did not exist in the first place.
a. Consideration Arguments
In general, a contract cannot be formed without consideration,
which requires reciprocal inducement and detriments at the time
the promise is made.77 In Noohi v. Toll Bros, Inc., the Fourth Circuit
invalidated an arbitration agreement that would have prevented a
buyer from bringing a claim in court but did not require the seller
to submit to arbitration in the same manner.78 The Fourth Circuit
stated that its holding was not because such arbitration agreements are, in general, unenforceable.79 Rather, the Fourth Circuit
found that the particular arbitration agreement at issue was unenforceable because it was only binding on the consumer, meaning
it lacked consideration at the time of its inception.80 Because the
underlying contract was invalid, the court found that Concepcion’s
embrace of arbitration agreements, save for a generally applicable
contract defense, was therefore inapplicable.81 If a binding arbitration agreement lacks consideration, or any of the requirements
to form a contract, it would, logically, be unenforceable. However,
because of the fact-intensive nature of these inquiries, it is difficult
to draw out a bright-line rule that future employee litigants could
use to successfully invalidate arbitration agreements.
b. Duress Arguments
A contract may be voidable because of duress if the inducement of assent involves an improper threat, harassment, or
entrapment.82 The threatened party in such cases must have no
reasonable alternative but to assent.83 Economic duress involves
a threat to property. A party using a defense of economic duress
must prove (1) that there was a wrongful or improper threat, (2) a

lack of reasonable alternative, and (3) that the threat substantially
contributed to the making of the contract.84 Although some courts
have held that taking advantage of desperation is sufficient, many
courts agree with the assessment by Judge Richard Posner, who
wrote that the fact that a party agreed to a settlement because of a
desperate need for money could not be the basis for duress unless
the opposing party had caused the financial hardship.85
In jurisdictions that allow claims of economic duress when a
party takes advantage of another party’s desperation, it is possible
that one could make a claim of economic duress in regard to binding arbitration.86 Finding a job is necessary to pay for the costs of
living, and when there are limited options, employees do not have
the flexibility to say no to a take-it-or-leave-it employment contract
that includes a binding arbitration clause, nor do they have the bargaining power to negotiate regarding such a clause. However, these
cases are unlikely to be successful; it is also likely that these cases
would be extremely fact-specific and that holdings would not be
broadly applicable.87 It is dubious that, in most cases, an employer

P.2d 15, 21 (Alaska 1978).
85. See Selmer Co. v. Blakeslee-Midwest Co., 704 F.2d 924, 928–29 (7th
Cir. 1983) (holding that a company was not under economic duress when it
entered into a settlement). Compare Butitta v. First Mortg. Corp., 578 N.E.2d
116, 120 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (holding that taking advantage of the financial stress
of another party may constitute duress, regardless of whether the party caused
the financial stress), with Smart Mktg. Group, Inc. v. Publ’ns Intern, Ltd., No.
04C0146, 2008 WL 4287704, at * 6 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 11, 2008) (quoting Selmer Co.,
704 F.2d at 928) (arguing that a party using overdue commission payments that
party caused as leverage in negotiations does not inherently deprive the other
party of free will, still leaving a question of fact).
86. There is a dearth of case law that successfully makes such an argument. Although the Court of Appeals of Texas held that an employer had used
economic duress to procure agreement to an arbitration clause, the holding was
reversed. In re RLS Legal Solutions, LLC, 156 S.W.3d 160, 163–65 (Tex. Ct.
App. 2005), rev’d, 221 S.W.2d 629 (Tex. 2007) (finding the employee explicitly
objected to the arbitration provision and employer withheld payment until the
employee signed the agreement containing the provision).
87. See Hopkins v. New Day Fin., 643 F. Supp. 2d 704, 716 (E.D. Pa. 2009)
(holding an arbitration provision was enforceable absent evidence that the
company was responsible for the financial pressure employees felt when they
signed the provision, even though the employees were told that they would be
fired if they chose not to sign); Carrick v. Aquent, Inc., 294 F. Supp. 2d 1012,
1019 (E.D. Wis. 2003) (finding a restrictive covenant, including an arbitration
provision, was enforceable and refusing to render contract unenforceable on
grounds of duress); In re RLS Legal Solutions, LLC, 221 S.W.2d at 630–32
(holding an arbitration clause was enforceable when economic duress in obtaining a signature to an employment agreement was not related explicitly to
an arbitration provision).

can be said to cause the economic duress that forces an employee
to enter into a binding arbitration agreement. However, in cases
involving harassment, it is possible to argue that the employer is
responsible for the employee’s financial situation if the employer’s harassment or failure to address harassment led to any costs or
pecuniary damages.
c. Unconscionability Arguments
Unconscionability can lead a judge to order the rescission of a
contract.88 However, under the FAA, arbitration agreements cannot
be found to be unconscionable simply because they are binding.89
There must be more involved. An unconscionable agreement must
typically be both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.
In general, binding arbitration agreements have only been found to
be procedurally unconscionable when (1) they involve an adhesion
contract,90 (2) no other location is bargaining on different terms or
providing alternative terms, (3) there is unequal bargaining power
between parties, (4) the terms are presented in a tricky manner or
hidden, and (5) no person with a reasonable choice would assent to
the terms.91
An agreement is substantively unconscionable when enforcement of the terms would be shocking to a judge’s conscience and
one’s superior bargaining power is used to form a contract that is so
one sided, it would be unjust to enforce.92 For example, in Hooters
of America, Inc. v. Phillips, the Fourth Circuit held that, although
an arbitration agreement to settle a harassment claim against an
employer was generally permitted, rescission was necessary because
the contract was so egregiously unfair that the rules essentially constituted a breach of the employer’s contractual obligation to draft
arbitration rules in good faith, meaning that it was substantively unconscionable.93 However, cases like Hooters are few and far

1981).

Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1623 (2018).
90. An adhesion contract, in this sense, is a contract drafted by one party
to be signed by another.

(stating that the provisions of the arbitration agreement at issue required that
all arbitrators be selected from list created by employer; placed no limits on
whom the employer could place on list; required employee to notice claims but
did not require employer to notice defenses; and allowed the employer, but not
the employee, to expand scope of proceedings).

between, and such determinations are extremely case specific due
to the limitations of the FAA.94 Additionally, the Fourth Circuit
decided Hooters prior to Concepcion or Epic Systems. The fact that
the average base pay of a “Hooters girl” is three dollars per hour,
or that “Hooters girls” are subject to disproportionate amounts of
sexual harassment, did not appear factor into the Fourth Circuit’s
analysis regarding the unconscionability of the agreement.95
d. Public Policy Arguments
A contract may be unenforceable on the grounds of public
policy if it is contrary to a previously addressed legislative goal or
if a potential consequence of enforcement clearly outweighs the
interest in its enforcement.96 Generally, when a contract is invalidated based upon public policy, the contract is already contrary to
a constitution, statute, regulation, or common law.97 Courts are far
less likely to apply a public policy argument absent any other legal
arguments.98 A public policy argument might be particularly compelling in cases involving low-wage workers, as opposed to white
collar workers who might have more bargaining power.
In weighing the interest in enforcement, a court must consider
(1) the parties’ justified expectations, (2) any forfeiture that would
result if enforcement were denied, and (3) any special public interest in the enforcement of the contract.99 In weighing public policy
interests against such enforcement, the court must consider (1)
the strength of that policy as manifested by legislation or judicial
decisions, (2) the likelihood that a refusal to enforce the term will
further that policy, (3) the seriousness of any misconduct involved
and the extent to which it was deliberate, and (4) the directness of
the connection between that misconduct and the term.100

violation of a fiduciary duty; interfering with the contract of another; exempting
liability from harm caused intentionally, recklessly, or negligently; and exempting consequences of misrepresentation. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 186, 192–96 (Am. Law Inst. 1981).

Courts have not seemingly yet but could reasonably find that
there is a public policy against binding employees to arbitration
due to (1) the economic necessity of employment, (2) the unequal
bargaining power, particularly in cases involving low-wage workers
with more limited resources, (3) the interest in having an impartial
court hear a claim, as opposed to an arbitrator, (4) the public interest in such cases and results being available for public record, which
is frequently not the case with arbitrated cases, or (5) conflict with
some other employment or civil rights law or protection, among
other arguments. However, when weighing employees’ actions
against prevailing policy interests in settling claims, minimizing
court dockets, and deferring to precedential interpretations of the
FAA, courts, including the Supreme Court, have been reluctant to
broadly find for employees in such cases due to its insistence that
such a contract cannot be unenforceable simply because it requires
arbitration.101 In Epic Systems, for example, the Supreme Court
rejected employees’ claims that enforcement of arbitration would
be “illegal” based upon the public policy advanced in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).102 The courts have also elected
to interpret the FAA to include even those arbitration agreements
resulting out of unequal bargaining power, as well as those included
as conditions of employment, despite reasonable interpretations of
the Act that would quash such a belief.103

exclusion in § 1.”). The FAA includes an exception for “contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in
foreign or interstate commerce,” although the Supreme Court has elected to
limit this interpretation only to transportation workers. See Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 (2012); Circuit City Stores, Inc., 532 U.S. at 109, 112 (holding an arbitration agreement as a condition for employment was enforceable in

The Status of Harassment and Discrimination Claims
Subject to Arbitration

The lack of general arguments one can successfully make
against binding arbitration between employers and employees does
not change simply because a cause of action is related to discrimination or harassment. In fact, in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane
Corp., the Supreme Court held that the FAA required enforcement
of arbitration agreements for claims arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.104
Although the Fourth Circuit in Hooters of America, Inc. v.
Phillips found an arbitration agreement to be invalid in a harassment case, it was not due to the nature of the claim or the fact
that arbitration was mandated.105 The invalidation was due to an
unconscionability argument extremely specific to that case.106 Any
unconscionability argument must refer to the time at which the
contract was made; therefore, whether the argument is made due
to a worker’s experience of sexual harassment or some other workplace ill is immaterial.107 One could argue that a binding arbitration
agreement that includes harassment and discrimination claims is
unconscionable or violates public policy. However, that argument
would likely fail, and it begs the question as to why a harassment or
discrimination claim can or should be placed on a different tier than
any other type of claim that involves equal or greater harm. Any
duress, consideration, or other generally applicable contract defenses would also have to be determined on a case-by-case basis and are
unlikely to succeed.

clauses or provide states more flexibility in this area, there does not
appear to be a way to legally render binding arbitration agreements
between employees and employers unenforceable.
a. State Legislative Solutions to Binding Arbitration
Any state legislation rendering unenforceable arbitration in
all employment contracts, or simply rendering unenforceable arbitration in cases involving harassment or discrimination, would
likely be invalidated. Such legislation would essentially be rendering arbitration clauses unenforceable due to the fact that they
require binding arbitration. The Supreme Court has held that the
FAA preempts such state action.109 Unless Congress amends the
FAA to provide states with more flexibility in this area, or the
Supreme Court overturns its precedent—which is highly unlikely—it is unlikely that any state law would be valid. However,
several states have passed or attempted to pass legislation on the
topic regardless.110 It remains to be seen whether these will be challenged or what will come of those challenges, but future litigation
seems likely.

harassment.111 Congress has already proposed several bills that
would address the issue.112
In December 2017, the House of Representatives and the Senate introduced bipartisan bills that would amend the FAA to render
unenforceable binding arbitration agreements in cases of sex discrimination.113 Given the tremendous impact of the #MeToo movement,
as well as other social and political realities, a focus on sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment, might make the bill more
likely to pass. However, this solution excludes other types of harassment, discrimination, and assault. These other types of claims might
also cause severe damages to employees, which these bills inherently
exclude due to their specificity. Legislatures should instead introduce bills that would render arbitration agreements unenforceable
for all harassment and discrimination claims, if not for all disputes.
In February 2019, Democrats introduced the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act of 2019 in the Senate and the
House of Representatives.114 This bill appears to be more or less a
reiteration of the Arbitration Fairness Acts of 2017 and 2018.115 As
opposed to focusing solely on sexual harassment disputes, however,
this bill addresses issues with arbitration regarding claims arising from all employment, consumer, or civil rights disputes.116 This
amendment would be the most inclusive and ideal, although, given
the current political climate and realities, it is less likely to pass.117

The fact that neither bill is bipartisan is indicative of the political
ties and roadblocks that would be involved in passing such a bill.118
Those who oppose the bill would likely state that it is overbroad,
prejudices employers, and would unnecessarily clog courts.
In October 2018, the Restoring Justice for Workers Act was
introduced in the House of Representatives.119 The bill was a direct
response to Epic Systems. It aimed to (1) prohibit pre-dispute arbitration agreements in employment contracts, (2) prohibit retaliation
against employees for refusing to arbitrate employment disputes,
(3) ensure that post-dispute arbitration agreements are voluntary, and (4) amend the National Labor Relations Act to prohibit
agreements that interfere with an employee’s right to take collective action in disputes.120 However warranted such a response to
Epic Systems might have been, there were no Republican cosponsors.121 Now that the Democrats have taken control of the House
and introduced the FAIR Act, it is unclear whether the bill would
pass in the Senate, or whether the president would sign such a bill.
Congress has also proposed prohibiting arbitration clauses that include a confidentiality clause.122 The bill would allow
employees to communicate about causes of action consistent with
federal and state whistleblower laws, as well as report, including
to public officials, and communicate about tortious or otherwise
unlawful conduct and issues of public policy.123 This solution would
address the public interest in knowledge about disputes and resolutions. However, it would not necessarily address the employee’s
right to a trial by jury or a fair binding decision.
The Safety Over Arbitration Act of 2017, which ultimately failed, would have prohibited arbitration in cases in which the
cause of action involved a threat to public health or safety.124 This
proposal is similar to sunshine-in-litigation statutes, which prohibit

the use of nondisclosure agreements to conceal public hazards.125
The reasoning behind such a statute would be to prevent concealment of information in which the public could be at risk. One could
argue that harassment in the workplace would fall under such a
specific exception due to the possibility that harassment, especially
if severe or pervasive enough, could place others at risk; however,
there would be no guarantee that a court would agree if the legislature chooses to remain so vague.
Congress could also amend the FAA to provide states with
more flexibility in regard to whether to consider certain types of
binding arbitration agreements illegal or against public policy. Such
an amendment would effectively render Concepcion irrelevant and
outdated. This fix might be easier to pass given the political makeup
and majority of the current Congress—particularly the Republican
majority in the Senate. However, it would not assist every employee in every state. It would be up to states to make such changes
on their own.
ii. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Solutions
Even though mandatory binding arbitration agreements prevent an employee from bringing an individual suit, and might bar
collective action, the Equal Employment Opportuntiy Commission (EEOC) is still permitted to pursue an individual claim and
victim-specific relief and essentially circumvent the restrictions of
mandatory binding arbitration.126 Therefore, the EEOC should
attempt to pursue as many viable claims of harassment and discrimination against employers as possible in cases in which employees
are limited. However, the EEOC cannot pursue every claim, leaving many victims of sexual or other forms of harassment with no
recourse. Additionally, this exception to circumvent arbitration
clauses does not necessarily apply to state agency action, which
an employee might be required to exhaust to make state claims of
discrimination.127
125. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 69.081 (2018) (defining “public hazard” as “an
instrumentality, including but not limited to any device, instrument, person,
procedure, product, or a condition of a device, instrument, person, procedure
or product, that has caused and is likely to cause injury”); Wash. Rev. Code
§ 4.24.601 (2018).
126. See generally EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc. 534 U.S. 279 (2002) (finding
the EEOC did not sign the arbitration agreement and sought to vindicate the
public interest).
127. See id. at 314–15 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“The Court should not
impose the FAA upon States in the absence of any indication that Congress
intended such a result, . . . yet refuse to interpret a federal statute in a manner

94

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

Vol. 26.69

It is also possible that the mandatory binding arbitration
agreement contains a confidentiality clause preventing the employee from reporting the claim to an agency such as the EEOC. Even
if such clauses are actually unenforceable, employees are not always
aware that that is the case, particularly in the case of low-income
workers who might not be educated or are likely not represented
by an attorney. Employers are therefore not inherently disincentivized from using mandatory binding arbitration.
c. Cultural and Companywide Shifts
In addition to legislative solutions, companies may change
policies independent of legal requirements. Several major companies, such as Uber and Lyft, have already stated that they will
not enforce binding arbitration agreements in cases of harassment
for drivers, riders, and employees who make sexual harassment
claims,128 and they have received positive press for effecting such
a change.129 Such a solution could improve the public’s perception
about a company, particularly in the #MeToo era.
However, there are several issues with simply relying on companies to change policies on their own. First, not all companies are
taking such action, and all employees should be entitled to the right
to take harassment and discrimination claims to court. Second,
some of these policies are overly narrow. For example, many only
address sexual harassment, as opposed to other forms of harassment. Further, it is still unclear why harassment or discrimination
claims are considered more or less severe that other types of workplace rights claims, or why there is more of a public interest in the
courts taking on such cases than other types of claims.
d. Recommendations
Currently, it seems that the best path to prevent arbitration
of harassment and discrimination claims in the employment context would be for Congress to pass legislation doing so. Long-term,
it would be best to pass legislation that would render arbitration
compatible with the FAA, especially when Congress has expressly encouraged
that claims under that federal statute be resolved through arbitration.”).

completely unenforceable in an employment context, particularly
since egregious violations of employees’ rights can involve claims
other than those of harassment and discrimination. The broader the prohibitions on arbitration agreements in employment, the
less likely employees with valid claims are denied of their rights. It
would prevent the continual need to add exceptions to the enforceability of arbitration agreements as new cutting-edge issues arise,
as well as prevent any potential legal or factual argument that an
employer might make to recategorize a sexual harassment claim to
support enforcement of the agreement. For now, if only legislation
addressing arbitration in sexual harassment cases can pass muster,
legislators might choose to settle, and it might have to do.
In the meantime, should individuals continue to bring cases
regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements, they must
focus on generally applicable contract claims, such as duress, that do
not attack the nature of arbitration itself.130 There are undoubtedly
arbitration agreements that are also unconscionable, but those arbitration agreements would be specific to each case.131 Additionally,
the EEOC should focus on pursuing harassment and discrimination claims in which the employee has signed a mandatory binding
arbitration agreement. Perhaps these shifts would affect whether
employers choose to include such clauses in employment contracts,
although there is no guarantee.
Binding arbitration is a beneficial tool to prevent court backlog
for those of relatively equal bargaining power.132 However, employers’ imposition of binding arbitration agreements on employees is a
coercive practice that prevents class actions, as well as some claims,
from being heard, publicized, or handled fairly.133 In the #MeToo
era, there has been a particular focus on protecting women from
sexual harassment in the workplace.134 It is in the public interest to
be aware of harassment claims made against employers, and it is in
the interest of workers to be able to bring a collective action, have
their case heard by a jury if they so choose, and hold employers

were so egregiously unfair that the arbitration process became one-sided was
unconscionable: the employer was not required to file responsive pleadings or
notice defenses, the employee was required to provide a list of fact witnesses
while the employer was not, and the possibilities for a third neutral arbitrator
were to be selected from a list the employer compiled).

appropriately accountable. Amending the FAA may be the only
way to force courts to stop enforcing fundamentally unfair arbitration agreements.135
B.

Nondisclosure Agreements

When the #MeToo movement took off in 2017, of particular
concern was the fact that many of the women who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact agreed
to confidentiality clauses in settlements.136 These clauses have
the obvious effect of preventing victims of harassment and other
inappropriate sexual behaviors from telling their stories. As more
stories about the use of nondisclosure agreements are reported,
these agreements and their enforceability have become a contentious topic.137
Nondisclosure agreements require signatory parties to keep
certain sensitive information confidential.138 Although nondisclosure agreements may be used to protect trade secrets or ideas,
they may also be included in employment contracts or settlement
agreements in cases of harassment in the workplace.139 The obligation to remain silent typically applies to the employer and the
employee alike. However, an employee may still report an incident
of harassment to the EEOC even after signing a settlement with
a nondisclosure agreement, although low-wage workers in particular might not be aware of that right due to lack of knowledge or
representation.

about the abuse she experienced at the hands of Larry Nassar by

disclosing confidential information, such as client lists, strategic plans, knowhow, technologies, marketing strategies, and proprietary relationships outside
the scope of their job responsibilities.” Id.

providing a voluntary victim statement for sentencing proceedings,
Maroney feared that USA Gymnastics would enforce a nondisclosure agreement that was included in their settlement.140 However,
public figures, such as actress Kristen Bell and model and television
host Chrissy Teigen, offered to pay the fine so that Maroney could
speak without the fear that USA Gymnastics would seek to enforce
the gag order.141 As inspiring as this solidarity might be, it is unlikely that public figures would offer to pay such an exorbitant amount
of money for a low-wage worker whose story might not receive the
same amount of publicity. Additionally, these workers would likely not have counsel informing them of the enforceability of such
a clause. Finally, harassment of low-wage workers is frequent and
often severe, such that providing funds for any given low-wage
worker would be almost impossible. Nondisclosure agreements
thus have more of a chilling effect on low-wage workers who cannot afford to take such a risk. Employees might wish to speak out
for multiple reasons, including to, like Maroney, testify in another
case that does not settle or is a criminal case, warn other workers,
inform the public of an employer’s failures, or empower others to
tell their stories, among others.
1.

Arguments for Including Nondisclosure Agreements
in Settlements for Workplace Harassment and
Discrimination Claims

Nondisclosure agreements incentivize employers to settle, as
well as to provide employees with more money when they do settle.
An employer would be incentivized to settle if including a nondisclosure agreement were an option because part of the benefit of
settling would be to prevent disclosure of details that might taint its
reputation. An employer would be more likely to settle for more
money as a result of inserting a nondisclosure agreement because
(1) the employee would, theoretically, be more likely to negotiate
more money in exchange for a nondisclosure agreement and (2)
increasing the amount of money would not appear to be an admission of guilt because details would never be disclosed.
Employers also note that not every claim is meritorious; some
cases are just nuisances that employers prefer to settle, whether to
prevent litigation, save time and resources, or prevent tarnishing

98

Vol. 26.69

their reputations even if the claim is weak or unreliable. Therefore,
employers are encouraged to settle, even when the facts are unclear
or the plaintiff’s claim is weak, because they can incorporate nondisclosure agreements. In that same vein, because false accusations
can be made, employers might want to protect the name of the
accused due to the potential impact on employability or reputation.
With a nondisclosure agreement, an employee would, presumably,
not be able to disclose the name of the accused individual, in addition to any other facts pertaining to the claim.
Finally, employers argue that employees do have a meaningful
choice between settling and litigating. Employees are able to weigh
their interests in deciding whether to settle, and they are capable of
making such decisions themselves. If these employees do not wish
to remain silent, they do have the option of pursuing a charge.
Because nondisclosure agreements are enforceable against
the employer as well, employees facing harassment or discrimination might want a nondisclosure agreement to maintain
confidentiality for fear of damage to reputation, unemployability, retaliation, or other reasons, particularly for a low-wage worker
with minimal recourse. Alternatively, employees might genuinely
prefer signing a nondisclosure agreement over enduring lengthy litigation that could take years to complete and would likely require
them to relive traumatic past experiences. Additionally, litigation
could be expensive, including court and attorney fees that low-wage
workers might not be able to afford. Low-wage workers might also
require immediate funds and thus might be unable to wait to go
through the litigation process, particularly if they are seeking new
employment or health care due to the harassment or assault. For
employees facing harassment or discrimination who have only
weak evidence, settling might be the only sure method of receiving
any monetary compensation, so incentivizing employers to settle is
imperative. Finally, even for employees with strong cases, litigation
is always risky, since success can depend upon the assigned judge,
the jury, and so many other factors. Litigation is especially risky if
a low-wage worker must bring a case pro se.
2.

Arguments Against Including Nondisclosure
Agreements

In permitting nondisclosure agreements in settlements for
such cases, legislatures allow employers to take advantage of
employees’ more immediate needs in exchange for silence. To
argue that employees have a say in the terms of the contract ignores
a significant bargaining power disparity that often exists between

2019

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

99

the employer and employee. Low-wage workers might not be
able to afford an attorney, or the same caliber of attorney that the
employer can afford; might not know their rights; and, as a result,
workers may be taken advantage of.142 The argument, for example, that employers are more likely to provide an employee with
more money in a settlement with a nondisclosure agreement due
to the increased room for negotiation assume an employee has the
requisite knowledge or understanding to effectively negotiate, or,
alternatively, counsel to assist.
The argument that employers lack incentive to settle with a
prohibition on nondisclosure agreements is also not entirely convincing. Employers would still be incentivized to settle in many
situations. Settling would still amount to less time and legal fees
than trial.143 Additionally, there are certain cases that a company
would not want a jury or the EEOC to hear, especially if the facts
are extreme, likely to incite emotion, or are not in their favor. In
these cases, there is a risk that the jury might award more in damages, monetary or otherwise, than a settlement or the EEOC might
require.144 There is also still a difference in the potential for media
attention between a settlement and a court case, depending upon
the facts.145 Of course, with a low-wage worker, there is less of a risk
of media attention, but in the age of #MeToo, an employer cannot
be too certain.
The concern about protecting innocent accused persons is
a valid one, but it is unclear how often false accusations actually
occur. The probability that an accusation for sexual harassment
or inappropriate sexual behavior is false is low.146 However, it is
reasonable, given our strongly held notions of due process, that an
employer would want to protect an accused employee as well as
the victim, particularly if the case is weak.147 That said, an employer

could protect such an employee by performing a diligent investigation, or by including a clause that only prevents the disclosure of the
alleged harasser’s name.
Finally, the argument that employees might want confidentiality is valid. However, companies would not typically have an
incentive to share details about harassment or assault in the workplace. It is therefore not likely that employees would have to be
concerned about employers sharing their stories; the concern is
therefore likely one sided. Additionally, if an employer is actually concerned about an employee’s rights and confidentiality, it does
not have to reveal details about the employee, even if there is no
nondisclosure agreement.
Prohibiting nondisclosure agreements would allow employees
to talk about their experiences at any time they feel comfortable,
if at all. Nondisclosure agreements can be a coercive mechanism
for covering up misconduct and shielding powerful players from
accountability for their actions. Employees might fear the repercussions of violating such an agreement, creating a chilling effect
for employees who might later seek to hold powerful individuals
accountable, even if not in a civil action. Employees, for the aforementioned reasons, might have to settle, and permitting employers
to include nondisclosure agreements. This allows employers to provide employees with take-it-or-leave-it settlement agreements that
require silence in exchange for settlement. Knowledge of these
incidents is also in the public interest; a prohibition would protect
the public right to know.
3.

Generally Applicable Contract Defenses

Much like arbitration agreements, nondisclosure agreements
may be invalid if the contract itself is void or voidable, whether due
to minority, lack of capacity, physical or economic duress, undue
influence, misrepresentation, nondisclosures, or unconscionability.148
However, as with arbitration, any arguments would be extremely specific to the case at hand, meaning that it would be difficult
to predict the potential outcome of a claim based upon precedent.
Despite clear differences in bargaining power between low-wage
workers and employers, a nondisclosure agreement would not be
automatically unconscionable.
Any liquidated damages for a breach of a nondisclosure agreement may only be “an amount that is reasonable in the light of the
anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties
148. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 161, 164, 175, 177, 208 (Am.

of proof of loss. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty.”149
Unreasonable liquidated damages are of particular concern to lowwage workers who cannot afford to breach such contracts otherwise
and might fear breaching the contract due to the stated damages
regardless of whether they are enforceable.

Solutions

There are infinite solutions to this issue that contemplate
employers’, employees’, and the public’s interests, each with their
own benefits and drawbacks. This Article will discuss some of the
most prominent or popular.
a. The Ayres Solutions
Ian Ayres outlines several potential compromises to address
the nondisclosure agreement debate, particularly in regard to
addressing the issue of repeat offenders.150 Addressing the issue of
repeat offenders would prevent future harassment. When repeat
offenders are not held accountable, they are likely to continue their
harassing behavior.151 One of Ayres’ suggestions involves placing
all employee allegations in an information escrow to be released
for investigation by the EEOC if another complaint is received
against the same accused party.152 This solution would potentially
place the responsibility on employers to ensure that an employee
accused of harassment does not offend again. The solution would
also serve the public interest by allowing for EEOC intervention
to hold employers accountable for repeat offenders, prevent future
harassment, and remove the burden of litigation from individual employees.
However, this solution does not address the reality that a
repeat offender might very well only have been reported once, particularly if the harasser is targeting low-wage workers who might
fear retaliation, are not part of a union or collective voice, or do
not otherwise feel safe reporting the incident to their employers. It
therefore leaves workers, particularly low-wage workers, in a potentially unsafe working environment.
Additionally, this solution would not serve the public interest of accountability for single offenses, since the EEOC would
not be alerted until a perpetrator is accused on another occasion.

This solution would also not necessarily serve the public interest
in having accessible information about the incident. Just because
the EEOC is investigating an incident does not mean the information will ever be made public. The EEOC is required to maintain
confidentiality during the investigation phase prior to bringing litigation, if it chooses to do so. It also must withhold evidence of
information gathered during conciliation or other informal discussions from subsequent hearings, unless it has the consent of both
parties to disclose such information.153 The public has an interest in
knowing whether employers are violating Title VII by harassing—
or permitting the harassment of—its employees, and this solution
does not address that need. This solution also requires all employees to feel comfortable reporting, and to understand how to do so
within their companies. Otherwise, repeat offenders will not be
properly identified.
The employer might also be reluctant to settle for the same
reasons it might be reluctant to settle without a nondisclosure agreement. In this case, the employer’s potential liability and instigating
an EEOC investigation is reliant upon the actions of the accused
employee, and the accused employee’s actions might not be entirely
within the employer’s control. The employer could certainly create
an environment in which harassment is not tolerated or hold the
accused employee accountable, but as long as the company does
not fire the accused employee, the company is taking a risk.
It is possible that the use of an escrow would make employers more likely to terminate accused employees for fear of EEOC
investigation. However, terminating accused employees can have
negative and lasting consequences for those employees that might
not be warranted or helpful in correcting behaviors. Rehabilitation and restorative justice would be far more effective for those
found to have harassed fellow employees.154 Internal proceedings
must also be fair and perceived as such. For example, depending
upon the circumstances, it might not be proportional or fair to be
fired for a single statement as opposed to assault or more egregious forms of harassment. If accused employees believe that a
company has treated them unfairly, the company opens itself up to
further liability.

Ayres’ second proposed solution is to explicitly carve out the
employee’s right to disclose information to the EEOC or other
investigative authorities, even with a nondisclosure agreement in
play.155 This solution would ensure that employees are aware of
their rights, potentially minimizing the chilling effect and increasing the probability that employees will be aware of their rights. It
would also allow the EEOC to “vindicate the public interest in preventing employment discrimination.”156
Even though this requirement would make it more likely that
employees would be aware of and take advantage of their right to
report, employees already retain these rights when they sign a settlement agreement; the right to file such a complaint is nonwaivable.157
However, low-wage workers might be less likely to be aware of that
fact, so it could be helpful for low-wage workers. Despite that, this
requirement would rely on the employer to actually take action in
carving out this right, and an employer would have little incentive
to make the employee aware of this right if the employer believes
that its conduct will not be reported. A low-wage worker who is
unaware of this right in the first place would be unlikely to know
that such a right should be carved out in a nondisclosure agreement. Finally, the same issues exist with this solution as the first
Ayres solution: The ability to report to the EEOC does not inherently make it possible for the public to learn about the harassment.
The third solution Ayres proffers involves including a condition in settlement agreements that any misrepresentation by the
perpetrator about the employee and perpetrator’s interactions
would constitute a material breach, which would allow the employee to speak freely about what occurred and correct any inaccurate
information.158
However, employers might be reluctant to settle for the same
reasons they might be reluctant to do so without a nondisclosure
agreement, simply because the agreement is reliant upon whether
the accused party misrepresents past interactions with the employee. As discussed, the employer does not always have full control
over its employees, even despite its best efforts. In terms of the

employee’s interests and the public interest, this compromise only
allows the employee to speak under a very narrow set of circumstances. Additionally, the accused party would be able to frame the
story before the employee, and the court of public opinion can be
unforgiving and lack nuance.
b. Limitations on the Facts Nondiscrimination Agreements
Can Cover
One other possible solution is to prohibit only nondisclosure
agreements that cover the facts or circumstances that give rise to a
claim, as opposed to the terms of a settlement. Arizona has already
enacted such a prohibition, while states such as California and
Rhode Island have sought, or are seeking, to institute such a prohibition.159 New York proposed, but ultimately rejected, a variation
of this solution that would allow nondisclosure agreements regarding the amount of money received in a settlement or the terms and
conditions of a settlement reached by an arbitrator.160 This solution
would allow employees to share their experiences, which would be
in the public interest, but it would not allow them to share the terms
of the settlement, allowing for some requirement of discretion.
One concern about this solution is that the terms of the
settlement might still be in the public interest. Whether the agreement was fair, for example, might be important for the public to
assess. How much the employee received in the settlement could
also provide an idea of the merits and severity of the claim, and
potentially the employer’s financial situation. The revealed amount
might also provide low-wage workers who feel they have little bargaining power and who have no counsel with grounds to ask for
more funds in a settlement negotiation; they would be able to better determine what their claim might be worth. Second, it might be
difficult for employees, including low-wage workers, to separate the
facts giving rise to the claim from the facts surrounding the terms of
the agreement or negotiations, particularly if they are asked about
them following any sort of media or attention, opening them up to
liability. Third, the employer might also actually prefer to conceal
the facts over the terms of the settlement because the facts of the
case are likely more sensitive and likely to attract attention than

105

the specific terms of the settlement. Therefore, there would still be
a potential issue with incentivizing employers to (1) settle and (2)
settle for more money. Employees might also want the facts to be
concealed for the same reason.
c. Revealing Information About the Harasser Prior
to Signing any Nondisclosure Agreement
Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, has suggested requiring employers to disclose whether the
same accused employee has been involved in prior settlements or
complaints during any new sexual harassment settlement negotiation.161 In finding out that a perpetrator is a repeat offender, an
employee might not want to agree to a nondisclosure agreement,
which might deter an employer from settling. Ultimately, it might
therefore lead the victim to bring legal charges. Additionally, if
the employee understands that the accused individual is a repeat
offender, the employee might be more likely to want to hold the
company or individual publicly accountable, particularly if the
employee knows that others might also come forward. Alternatively, the solution might also embolden employees to negotiate better
terms or demand that the repeat offender be terminated.
However, similar to Ayers’ second solution, because this solution would require affirmative and honest action by employers,
it might not work. Even with strict enforcement provisions that
would hold them accountable for not revealing such information,
(1) employees might never know they were wronged or that their
employers lied and (2) employees might not want to risk violating the terms of the nondisclosure agreement. This solution also
still permits the use of nondisclosure agreements; therefore, it could
also complicate a company’s duty to enforce prior nondisclosure
agreements. A company might, arguably, have to violate a previous agreement to fulfill this requirement. Special carve-outs might
be necessary for future nondisclosure agreements in this case. The
solution also might fail for similar reasons to Ayers’ first solution:
a repeat harasser targeting low-wage workers simply might not
have been reported despite serial behavior, leaving workers to rely
on incomplete information in determining how to negotiate the
settlement.

d. Procedural Limitations on Nondiscrimination
Agreements
Another proposed solution is to require employers to offer
a settlement both with and without the nondisclosure agreement,
even if the option without the nondisclosure agreement would provide the employee with less money.162 This solution would prevent
employers from presenting take-it-or-leave-it settlement agreement terms that include nondisclosure clauses. However, even with
these supposed choices, low-wage workers still might feel like they
have no choice but to agree to the nondisclosure agreement option.
If the monetary disparity is that significant, the terms without the
nondisclosure agreement might not properly cover funds needed
while attempting to find another job or receiving mental or other
health treatment, for example. If the disparity is large enough, the
practice could arguably still be coercive. Employers could also still
wield their increased negotiating power or apply disproportionate
pressure on the employee to choose the option containing the nondisclosure agreement.
Some states have instituted prohibitions on nondisclosure
agreements when the settlement is a result of certain behaviors.
In California, nondisclosure agreements in settlements are prohibited in cases of felony assault, sexual exploitation of a minor, or
child sexual assault.163 McKayla Maroney, for example, argued that
the nondisclosure agreement she signed against Larry Nassar was
invalid because it settled a matter establishing a cause of action for
an act of child sexual abuse.164 Other states have “sunshine-in-litigation” statutes that deem clauses that conceal information that
could be considered a public hazard to be both against public policy and unenforceable.165
This solution would prevent covering up the most extreme
behaviors with a nondisclosure agreement. Surely, the more hazardous or extreme the act, the greater the public interest would be
in knowing about the issue. These laws can also include other types

§ 4.24.601 (2018).

107

of harassment or assault, as opposed to just including those of a
sexual nature. However, this solution would only prevent covering
up the most extreme behavior, and legislatures would be required
to draw moral and ethical lines that might be difficult to discern.
If a legislature decided not to draw any specific lines, such as in a
sunshine-in-litigation statute concerning public hazards, the statute
might be too vague, meaning that there is no guarantee in any particular situation whether the act giving rise to the complaint is one
that would trigger a prohibition on nondisclosure agreements. Due
to the vague nature of such legislation, advocacy would be necessary to ensure that it is applied to protect employees, and even then,
such advocacy might not be successful. In particular, low-wage
workers might not have access to counsel to perform such statutory heavy advocacy.
Another solution would involve ensuring that, even if nondisclosure agreements about the facts or terms of a settlement are
entirely prohibited in harassment and assault cases, the employee’s
name could still remain confidential upon request during negotiations or court order. Indiana attempted this solution in a bill that
failed to pass the Indiana House of Representatives.166 This solution would address concerns about employee anonymity in banning
nondisclosure agreements. However, this solution would invite
some of the same criticisms from employers as an all-out ban, since
the only issue this solution addresses is employee anonymity. This
solution might also empower employees to disclose details about a
company anonymously because there would be no nondisclosure
agreement and their identities would be protected. Anonymity can
decrease accountability because of the more limited consequences,
allowing sources to mischaracterize the facts.
Another issue with this solution is that employees would have
to be aware of this right in order to take advantage of it. However,
employees, particularly low-wage workers, may not have lawyers
in these negotiations who can make them aware of their rights. In
the case that an employee does not, perhaps it would be useful to
require that the employee’s rights are outlined in the agreement.
This solution could also require additional payment or retention
of legal counsel to pursue a court order, which many low-income
employees in particular might not be able to afford. Those who do
not secure counsel might experience confusion throughout the process or might simply be ineffective at securing the court order.
Washington State has passed a ban on nondisclosure agreements that limit, prevent, or punish a witness for providing
166. H.B. 1237, 120th Gen. Assemb., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ind. 2018).

108

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

Vol. 26.69

testimony or discovery in other cases related to sexual assault or
harassment, even if the individual signed a nondisclosure agreement.167 This ban would prevent instances like that which Maroney
experienced when she faced potential punishment for providing a
voluntary victim impact statement at the sentencing of Larry Nassar, who sexually abused her.168 This ban would also help to support
later cases for others experiencing sexual harassment, assault, or
discrimination, and would prevent covering up evidence required
to prove such cases, particularly when employees in those later
cases have not signed any sort of settlement or nondisclosure agreement. This solution would address the public interest in holding
repeat offenders accountable. However, this solution still does
not necessarily allow employees to speak on their own; the exception only applies if they need to provide evidence or testimony at
a later time. Employees might also feel limited in what they can
say, even if they are allowed to speak candidly in such a context.
This solution would theoretically eliminate a company’s ability
to contractually limit such disclosures. Many employers currently include requirements to inform the employer of any subpoena
so that it can quash the subpoena, as well as requirements to limit
disclosure to only what is necessary to share, among others, in nondisclosure agreements. However, it is unclear what Washington’s
statute encompasses as a requirement limiting such disclosures and
how far those protections would extend.
The New Jersey General Assembly introduced a solution
that would render nondisclosure agreements in settlements unenforceable against employees.169 However, if the employee publicly
revealed any information such that the employer was reasonably
identifiable, the nondisclosure agreement would become unenforceable against the employer.170 This solution addresses concerns
about employee confidentiality, since employees only come forward if and when they are ready. The solution would also allow
employees to tell their stories.
Employers would have the same issues with this solution as
they would with an all-out prohibition; however, arguably, this solution provides even less of an incentive to settle due to the unequal
167. S.B. 6068, 65th Leg., 2018 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2018) (enacted)
(stating “a nondisclosure policy or agreement that purports to limit the ability
of any person to produce evidence regarding past instances of sexual harassment or sexual assault by a party to the civil action does not affect discovery or
the availability of witness testimony relating to that civil action”).

application of the nondisclosure agreement. There would be no
guarantee that an employee would not come forward, consequently setting the narrative before the employer would even be able
to speak to the issue. On the other hand, a large employer would
presumably have the resources to effectively refute and overcome
accusations. An accused harasser might not.
Another solution is to only allow nondisclosure agreements
to be included in settlements when mediation occurs, or when some
third party is tasked with resolving the conflict. This solution would
address potential concerns about unequal bargaining power and
fundamental fairness. However, one challenge with this solution is
ensuring that a third-party mediator is truly unbiased, given that a
mediator is likely to receive payment from the employer. Additionally, employees might still change their minds later on and want to
speak, even if, at the time, they do agree to a nondisclosure agreement in mediation. Finally, this solution still does not address the
public interest of knowledge about the occurrence.
Allowing nondisclosure agreements to be included in settlements for harassment cases when the employee requests one is a
solution that has appeared in bills introduced in California and
Rhode Island, among other states.171 This solution would still permit nondisclosure agreements to exist, but only if the employee
makes such a request. Under the Rhode Island bill, such a request
from the employee must be explicit and unilateral.172 This solution
would address concerns about employee confidentiality. However,
this solution would be almost impossible to enforce. Ensuring that
employers are not suggesting that the employee “voluntarily” ask
for the inclusion of a nondisclosure agreement would be incredibly difficult.
Minnesota has considered and rejected, while New Jersey is
currently considering, legislation that would bar the use of nondisclosure agreements to settle sexual assault and harassment claims
against certain state officers and employees, members of the legislature, and candidates.173 Arguably, there is a much greater public
interest in awareness of any misconduct by government officials,
since they create our laws and dictate policies. Those who run for,
and serve in, public office should also be aware that their actions
will be under greater scrutiny. Therefore, states might consider at

the very least prohibiting nondisclosure agreements only in settlements with government officials, candidates, or certain high-ranking
employees. No requirement would have to be imposed on any
private employer; the requirements would only be imposed on
public officials, political candidates, and certain high-ranking government employees.
The most obvious barrier to passing such legislation is that
it would require those who are currently in office to hold themselves accountable.174 Government officials might also be less
likely to settle without the promise of nondisclosure, which could
force employees to endure lengthy trials that rehash traumatic experiences. Another potential issue with this solution is that,
again, employees might prefer confidentiality. Finally, this solution only applies to the government, and the public certainly has
an interest when these incidents take place in private employment
settings as well.
e. Implementing Reporting Requirements
The federal or state governments might also require publicly traded companies to report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or state securities regulators when they face
widespread sexual-harassment claims, when those claims are
brought against high-level executives, when companies settle, and
for how much they settle. This solution, which was discussed in an
article in The Nation and which Congress has proposed, would not
specially ban nondisclosure agreements such that employees could
speak about their experiences.175 However, The Nation’s suggestion
would require companies to acknowledge widespread claims or
claims against high-level executives, and Congress’ proposal would
require companies to acknowledge the number of settlements

and the amount for which they settle in sexual abuse and covered
harassment and discrimination cases. Stockholders in publicly traded companies should be entitled to this information.
Of course, stockholders have a large financial interest in
whether there is widespread sexual harassment, claims against
high-level executives, or settlements, since these could affect the
company’s success. Stockholders also have an interest in knowing
how much a company paid in a settlement agreement in terms of
the company’s financials. Although Congress’ solution would have
still prevented employees from discussing their stories or the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, at least the public would
be aware that the business entered into such an agreement and for
how much.176 Reform regarding the reporting of settlements and
settlement amounts appears to be more helpful in these circumstances. This solution also takes pressure off of employees to come
forward with their specific stories if they choose not to do so. The
information would already, hopefully, be accurately recorded in a
report to the SEC. Should legislatures pursue this route, they must
be sure to include all types of harassment claims based on protected bases. Congress appears to have included a number of types of
harassment in addition to sexual harassment in its proposals.177
One challenge is that this reporting mechanism would rely
on the company to report the incidents. The Nation’s suggestion regarding reporting of widespread claims or claims against
high-ranking executives could allow for false claims of harassment to affect a company’s market performance, although, again,
it appears that most complaints of harassment are reliable. The
employee could also provide helpful information or context that is
not available just by looking at an SEC report. One final issue with
this solution is that it only applies to publicly traded companies, and
many businesses are not. In fact, low wage workers are much more
likely to work at small businesses.178
Marci Hamilton, a law professor and founder of CHILD
USA, proposed placing pressure on employment practices liability
insurance providers under threat of legislative reforms because of
the role these providers play in encouraging nondisclosure and covering the acts of companies.179 Hamilton believes that if ­legislatures

propose legislative reforms regarding insurance policies and
requirements, insurance providers will begin to require companies
to undergo trainings and conduct audits as a condition of coverage.180 Hamilton believes legislatures must also place pressure on
insurance companies to address the promotion of nondisclosure
agreements, intimidation, and other “predator-friendly” practices.181
However, this solution is indirect, and only potentially addresses the
working environment. This solution would not involve reporting
of incidents, nor would it permit employees who signed nondisclosure agreements to speak about their cases. It could be something
that legislatures consider as a separate matter to address workplace
environment. It also does not necessarily address the small businesses at which low-income workers are employed.
Federal or state governments might also require employers
to report detailed information, such as the number of complaints
they receive, whether those complaints involve repeat offenders,
and/or how much the company has paid to settle harassment or discrimination claims. This solution, which is similar to SEC reporting
requirements but would apply to even those employers that are not
publicly traded companies, would also not allow specific employees
to tell their stories. However, the public would be made aware of
the existence of settlements and claims, even if it is unable to access
more detailed information. This solution would protect the privacy
of employees, as well as the interest of the company in still permitting nondisclosure.
One potential drawback is that these statistics are just numbers, and they might not tell the entire story. Employees would be
able to fill in gaps and provide context that data simply could not
provide. Another issue with this solution is that numbers can be
misleading. The success of this solution would require both employees to feel comfortable and trust the system enough to report and
the employer to properly report. Underreporting might occur
because companies compare themselves to one another in an effort
to achieve the lowest relative report rate, even though companies
with the highest report rates might actually be the companies creating a safe enough environment that employees feel comfortable
coming forward. These same issues have occurred on college campuses in regard to required reporting of sexual assault under the
Clery Act—colleges have, in the past, feared reporting high rates

of sexual assault, even though reporting zero incidents of sexual
assault is both unrealistic and implies students do not feel comfortable reporting.182
At the very minimum, nondisclosure agreements in harassment settlements should be completely prohibited for members of
the legislature, certain high-ranking government employees, and
political candidates. In these cases, the public interest far outweighs
the interests of the accused party. Additionally, given their positions
of power, these officials, candidates, and high-ranking employees
tend to have the resources or ability to defend themselves and control the narrative. The power disparity in these cases is substantial;
therefore employees should be provided with the option to remain
anonymous by request in the negotiating process or court order if
they are concerned that the employer will use their names and fear
retaliation or do not wish to receive attention.
For private employers, a combination of many of these solutions would be ideal. Perhaps the SEC and state securities and
exchange commissions could enforce publicly traded business’
duties to their stockholders by requiring reporting of widespread
claims, or claims against high-ranking executives. An information
escrow permitting the EEOC to investigate when there are multiple claims against a repeat offender and mandatory reporting of
claims and settlements would also be a helpful undertaking, even if
it is not in nondisclosure agreements’ stead. Mandatory reporting
or reporting to the SEC, however, still would not permit employees
to tell their stories if a nondisclosure agreement were in place. The
numbers alone are not sufficient to capture the extent of the problem, particularly if companies were required to self-report or the
company environment is not conducive to reporting harassment.
Permitting the EEOC to investigate claims against repeat offenders would also help to prevent harassment and hold the offender
accountable, but it would not necessarily result in public knowledge
of the incidents that transpired due to EEOC privacy requirements
and policies.
f. Prohibition of Nondisclosure Agreements
The best, although imperfect, solution that deals directly with
nondisclosure for private employers is the same as the best solution for public officials: prohibit nondisclosure agreements but
allow the employee’s name to remain confidential by request in
the settlement negotiation process or court order. A request for

114

confidentiality would not be a completely one-sided nondisclosure
agreement because a company would still be permitted to discuss
the incident. However, it would not be permitted to release the
name of the employee. Although only allowing one-sided nondisclosure agreements, in which the duty to remain silent is on the
employer, would be similar and involve less work for the employee, there would be no guarantee that the employer would agree to a
completely one-sided nondisclosure agreement. Therefore, a solution that allows employees to keep their names confidential upon
request or court order would better protect employees who truly
wish to remain anonymous.
Overall, employers will still be incentivized to settle. There
are still myriad incentives to do so, including time, money, and
potential publicity. One drawback is that employers might not be
willing to settle for as much money. Nondisclosure agreements
provide additional leverage for employees to negotiate better settlements. Additionally, allowing nondisclosure agreements might
allow employers to feel more comfortable providing more money
because the amount of money, which could indicate fault or severity,
would not be released. However, even without nondisclosure agreements, employers would still be incentivized to settle, and as such,
they would need to negotiate in a manner such that an employee
would agree to a settlement. Employers would still have to consider the employee’s monetary demands in negotiations. Therefore,
even if employees do not walk away with as much money as they
might have received if including a nondisclosure agreement were
an option, employees can still negotiate with employers regarding
the amount of money they receive. Again, these assertions are all
based on the assumption that the employees are represented, there
are no language barriers, and the employees feel that they are in
a position to negotiate, which is less likely when considering lowwage workers.
If the concern with prohibiting nondisclosure agreements is
truly that employees might want confidentiality, allowing employees to request anonymity in negotiations or by court order would
address that concern. Employers that are actually concerned about
protecting the identities of employees could simply do so voluntarily as opposed to using this argument as a talking point to support
the use of nondisclosure agreements.
If an employee does have counsel, requiring a court order
would not be the largest burden to impose. However, it might
require an employee to pay or secure an attorney for additional time
and to actually file a claim in court, which a low-income employee

2019

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

115

might not be able to afford. Otherwise, the employee would have
to request the court order pro se, which could result in confusion
throughout the process and ultimately prove unsuccessful. If an
employee does not have counsel, which is more likely for low-income workers, requiring a court order would be extremely onerous.
Another drawback is the need for employees to be aware of
their right to the court order, which would be difficult to ensure
without an attorney. Employers could be required to explain these
rights to employees during the negotiation process, but there would
be no guarantee that employers would honor such requirements.
One final drawback is the potential for court involvement when the
employee does not want to enter into a court process. These processes can take a long time and might require employees to relive
past traumatic experiences. The purpose of settling is to avoid this
process, and when employees are required to obtain a court order
to protect their anonymity, it defeats this purpose. There would be
no guarantee that employers would be willing to, without a court
order, include an employee’s anonymity in the terms of a settlement.
g. Recommendation
Settlement is a valuable tool both for employers and employees. For employers, settlement saves time, energy, funds, and,
potentially, prevents increased publicity. For employees, settlement
prevents drudging up past traumatic experiences, saves money, and
can allow for quicker access to funds while attempting to find new
employment or for needed medical care as a result of harassment
or assault. Overall, settlement prevents court backlog. However,
these interests in settling are not a justification for allowing employers to keep instances of harassment and assault a secret. Even
without nondisclosure agreements, there is still an incentive for
employers and employees alike to settle.
Settlement should be encouraged as a matter of public
interest. However, the public interest in knowing what occurred,
preventing future harassment, and holding employers accountable
outweighs employers’ arguments to allow nondisclosure agreements in settlements regarding workplace harassment or assault.
If there is concern about the employee’s need for confidentiality,
jurisdictions could still allow employees to remain anonymous by
request or court order, which can be sealed. Even so, the public
still has the right to know what occurred to (1) inform its consumption decisions, (2) inform its employment decisions, (3) understand
the effectiveness of existing policies pertaining to harassment, and
(4) understand the scope and nature of persistent harassment,
among other reasons. In cases of harassment or assault claims

116

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

Vol. 26.69

against public officials, there is an even greater public interest in
the matter because these officials set the legislative agenda and
create policy.
Prohibitions on nondisclosure agreements are not sufficient
to eradicate harassment. Reporting requirements, culture changes
beyond legislation, notifying employees of their rights in the settlement agreement, and other changes are also helpful and potentially
necessary to protect the public interest. Additionally, making what
occurs during internal processes confidential is also problematic, and continuing to allow that to occur would, at least partially,
defeat the purpose of prohibiting nondisclosure agreements in such
settlements. Ensuring that employees are not silenced by virtue
of signing a settlement agreement should they decide to speak is a
matter of public interest that must be protected.

Lack of Title VII Protections

There are several pitfalls and gaps directly in Title VII that
make it difficult for all workers to assert their right to work in an
environment free from sexual harassment. Employers take advantage of these gaps to avoid potential liability. This Article will
describe several problems with Title VII and its limitations.183

There are myriad reasons why Harvey Weinstein’s accusers might have waited many years to report the harassment they

or concern about retaliation and blacklisting in the industry.184 One
key reason for the delay might have been that these women were

likely independent contractors, meaning any protections afforded
to employees under Title VII did not apply to them.185 It is also
possible that some were misclassified as independent contractors
despite their status as employees, so they might not have been
aware that they too were protected under Title VII.186 These types
of issues not only affect struggling actors attempting to break into
the entertainment industry, who might have little bargaining power,
but they also extend into myriad industries that almost exclusively
employ low-wage workers.187
Title VII provides protections for employees.188 Title VII
vaguely defines an employee as “an individual employed by an
employer.”189 Therefore, Title VII excludes protection for independent contractors, who are viewed not as employees, but entities or
individuals who are hired to perform a specific task and are able to
exercise their own decisionmaking, discretion, and power of negotiation.190 To avoid compliance with antidiscrimination laws, among
other workplace protections, employers are increasingly misclassifying their employees as independent contractors, or simply hiring
workers who are legally considered independent contractors, rather
than employees.191 This practice is particularly harmful for lowwage workers with more limited bargaining power and who are
already more vulnerable to sexual harassment. Regardless of the
severity of the offense, if an individual is not considered an employee, Title VII claims cannot be pursued, leaving workers susceptible
to harassment and companies free from liability, barring any state
provisions that extend such protections or contractual provisions
between the company and the independent contractor.192
Courts are empowered to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee when a dispute
arises. Although the label placed on a worker is not dispositive,

118

these classifications must be challenged to affect the worker’s
title.193 Once the label is challenged, courts typically apply a hybrid
between the economic realities and common law right to control
tests, depending upon the jurisdiction.194 For example, in Alexander
v. FedEx Ground Package Systems, the Ninth Circuit applied a test
that considered whether the person to whom service is rendered
had the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing
the result desired.195
Factors used to determine the right to control include (1)
whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (2) the kind of occupation, with reference to
whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision; (3) the
skill required in the particular occupation; (4) whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place
of work for the person doing the work; (5) the length of time for
which the services are to be performed; (6) the method of payment,
whether by the time or by the job; (7) whether or not the work
is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (8) whether
or not the parties believe they are creating an employer-employee
relationship.196 Other jurisdictions have exclusively applied a similar economic realities test that focuses on the amount of control
the worker has over his or her job, as well as (1) the kind of occupation, (2) the skills required for the work, (3) who furnishes the
equipment used and place of work, (4) method of payment, and (5)
benefits accumulated.197 These factors permit a court to correct any
misclassification of low-wage workers with more limited bargaining
power, particularly given that the level of skill, the method of payment, and the intent of the parties are considered.
When employers hire independent contractors to do work
that would otherwise be conducted by employees, or when employers misclassify employees as independent contractors to skirt laws,
workers are unable to seek remedies for harassment they experience in the workplace. Even if a worker is actually an employee,
the worker might not be aware of his or her rights due to his or her
classification as an independent contractor. That is particularly true

of low-wage workers who might not be able to access legal counsel,
feel that they cannot assert their rights due to a power imbalance,
or who might be more easily intimidated if they are not educated
about their legal rights.
2.

Solutions

An ideal solution to fill the gaps in Title VII coverage would be
to amend Title VII to include protections for independent contractors. In 2018, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced
the Protecting Independent Contractors from Discrimination Act
in an attempt to do so.198 However, the bill was largely unsuccessful and ultimately only gained one cosponsor.199 Such attempts
are more likely to be successful in states due to the disposition
of Congress. New York recently passed legislation that prohibits
employers from permitting sexual harassment of nonemployees in
the workplace, meaning that it is irrelevant whether workers are
classified as independent contractors or employees.200
If Congress or the states do not address the issue themselves,
however, the EEOC should maintain as flexible definitions of who
constitutes an employee as is permitted under Title VII. Currently,
the EEOC’s definition of “employee” is the same vague definition
that is applied in Title VII.201 However, the EEOC Compliance
Manual contains a number of factors to apply in considering whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee, including
but not limited to, (1) the employer’s right to control when, where,
and how work is performed; (2) the level of skill required for the
work; (3) whether the employer furnishes tools; (4) whether the
work is performed on the employer’s premises; (5) whether there
is a continuing relationship between the worker and the employer; and (6) whether the employer has the right to assign additional
projects.202 Even with this broad definition, however, the EEOC
is not empowered to punish employers for misclassification absent
any cause for discrimination. Therefore, it might be beneficial for
Congress, as well as state legislatures, to codify factors or empower

broad agency enforcement to ensure that courts are exploring the
correct factors. Without a court’s willingness to view classification
beyond the label, employees will be denied vital protections.
These efforts should be pursued, not just for the benefit of
workers, but also for the proper recoupment of taxes. In 1984, the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that misclassification
of employees as independent contractors led to revenue losses of
about $1.6 billion.203 In a 2009 report, the Government Accountability Office called on the Department of Labor and IRS to enhance
enforcement of misclassification, improve outreach to workers, and
improve interagency coordination.204 States have a vested interest
in pursuing claims of misclassification due to the loss of millions
of dollars per year in taxes.205 Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have passed legislation to target
misclassification.206 New York has targeted specific industries that
are more likely to misclassify workers, including the cab and construction industries.207 Massachusetts has taken a stricter approach,
implementing a strong rebuttable presumption that workers are
employees.208 States and their attorneys general must continue to
pursue these cases, implement a clear and formal complaint process, and conduct outreach to ensure workers are aware of (1) their
rights and signs that they are being misclassified and (2) how and
where to file complaints against employers. States such as California have also adopted standards presuming that all workers are
employees, placing the burden on those classifying the workers.209

In terms of encouraging employers to hire individuals as
employees as opposed to independent contractors, increased
enforcement for those who misclassify their workers as independent
contractors might encourage employers to hire workers as employees out of concern for liability. However, it is unclear how else
to incentivize businesses to not take a resource-saving action that
might well be legal. Independent contractors are not only cheaper, but they also do not require benefits, unless otherwise stipulated
in the contract initiating the relationship. Perhaps some sort of tax
incentive for employers might be put in place, or federal agencies
might wish to be more selective about to whom they award contracts. If anything, the current tax law encourages employees to
become independent contractors and waive their rights as employees, further perpetuating this uphill battle.210

Fear of Retaliation

Background

Sandra Pezqueda was a dishwasher and chef’s assistant at the
Terrenea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.211 When her
supervisor consistently offered her more hours if she would go out
with him, tried to kiss her, and called her at her home to ask her if
she would get coffee with him, Pezqueda complained to another
supervisor.212 Soon after, supervisors began to criticize her work,
and she was eventually fired.213 Pezqueda lamented on her traumatic experience, stating, “I knew if I spoke up there would be
retaliation . . . That’s why other women never speak up about what
happened to them.”214 Pezqueda, however, is not alone in her fear
of retaliation as a low-wage worker.

including making charges or otherwise testifying, assisting, or participating in enforcement proceedings.215 Retaliation may include
demotion, firing, or any other retaliatory act.216 Retaliation has a
severe chilling effect on the reporting of discrimination in the workplace; without such prohibitions, civil rights protections such as
those under Title VII would essentially be inoperable.217 However,
as common sense would dictate, simply making an act illegal does
not inherently prevent individuals from taking such action. Despite
prohibitions against retaliation, the most frequently alleged bases
of discrimination in federal sector cases is retaliation.218 In fiscal
year 2017, the EEOC received 41,097 retaliation complaints out of
a total 84,254 complaints.219
Low-wage workers, who often cannot afford to risk losing their
jobs or who might fear that they will not be employable based upon
their particular skill sets, geographic location, or other factors, may
face increased fears about the potential for retaliation. By increasing scrutiny on employers who may condone harassment through
inaction, #MeToo has made it harmful for an employer’s reputation to retaliate against employees for making sexual harassment
claims.220 The letter of the law certainly prohibits such retaliation.221
However, such cases may be difficult to prove or enforce. Additionally, if employers believe they will gain more from instilling fear and

taking a retaliatory action than they might lose from any punishment for taking such a retaliatory act, the incentive for retaliation
still exists. The law falls short in this regard.
Retaliation may be established if “a reasonable worker
might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity” should an
employer take a specific action.222 To establish a prima facie case
of a retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) her employer took adverse employment action
against her, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.223 A plaintiff may also indirectly
demonstrate retaliation if she can demonstrate that (1) after she
complained of discrimination, she was subject to an adverse action
despite performing up to the employer’s legitimate job expectations and (2) similarly situated employees were not subject to such
an adverse action.224
Courts have expressed concerns that if retaliation protections become too broad, employers will fear merely managing their
employees.225 However, this concern is misplaced, since the standard is an objective standard. Courts must determine whether an
action is materially adverse or whether a reasonable employee
would be dissuaded from taking protected actions.226 Additionally, the Supreme Court has also abrogated attempts at expanding
what constitutes an adverse action.227 In Mattern v. Eastman Kodak
Company, the Fifth Circuit held that theft of an employee’s tools
and an alleged visit by supervisors to an employee’s home, which
included verbal threats of termination, reprimand for not being at
the employee’s assigned station, and placing an employee on final
warning, were not adverse actions.228 The Fifth Circuit held that
Title VII only addressed ultimate employment decisions, including
hiring, firing, promotion, and compensation.229
222. See Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 174

It is unclear where the Supreme Court might lie in future
cases. Based upon the Court’s holding in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, it is possible the Court might
establish more stringent requirements.230 In that case, the Supreme
Court held that Title VII retaliation claims must demonstrate butfor causation, as opposed to simply proving that race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin was a motivating factor as set out in the
Civil Rights act.231 If the Supreme Court could overturn Abood
v. Detroit Board of Education in Janus v. AFSME, delivering a significant blow to public sector unions that rely on fair share fees,
it is not without reason to suspect the Supreme Court could also
abridge workers’ rights in this respect in favor of similar corporate interests.232 If it is true that low-wage workers are unable to
hire effective, or any, counsel, the barriers for bringing a retaliation
claim are even more extensive.
2.

Solutions

Practically speaking, access to legal representation, whether
in the form of a demand letter or some other tactic that puts an
employer on alert that any retaliation will be subject to legal challenge, might assuage workers’ fear of retaliation. Unionization and
collective action might also help workers who fear retaliation to
feel more secure due to the sheer power of numbers.
Legally, punishment for retaliation must be strengthened to
be effective. Currently, even if an employer is sanctioned for retaliating against one employee, employers benefit from instilling fear in
other employees. It therefore might still be far more worth it, particularly for wealthy businesses, to retaliate against one employee
and pay damages than to not retaliate and risk backlash by numerous employees at a later date. The law must better address the
far-reaching results of retaliation, as opposed to isolating its effects
in a single case, when considering punishment for retaliation.

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

125

Lack of Protections for Domestic Workers and Farmworkers
1.

Background

Many antidiscrimination laws, including Title VII, only apply
to employers with at least fifteen employees.233 Naturally, this
provision excludes many domestic workers from the protections
available to other employees.234 In some instances, domestic workers might also be independent contractors; in such cases, domestic
workers would also not be protected under federal law.235 Many
state antidiscrimination statutes also explicitly exclude domestic
workers.236 Although states such as New York do provide specific protections for domestic workers, it is neither guaranteed nor is
it the norm.237
Despite a general lack of protection under federal and state
antidiscrimination laws, domestic workers are subject to some of the
most extreme instances of sexual harassment and abuse because of
(1) the isolating working conditions, (2) their class, (3) their migrant
status, (4) their gender, since domestic workers are overwhelmingly
women, and (5) the threat of lost employment and the fact that the
supply of domestic workers to exceed demands.238 In one Nation233. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) (2012) (defining “employer” as “a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees
for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current
or preceding calendar year”); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (establishing unlawful employment practices for employers).
234. Although this piece focuses on Title VII, it is important to note that
farm and domestic workers were explicitly excluded from other worker protection statutes, such as the FLSA and the NLRA. Cf. Marc Linder, Farm Workers
and the Fair Labor Standards Act: Racial Discrimination in the New Deal, 65
Tex. L. Rev. 1335, 1336–37, 1336 n.12 (1987) (describing the racial discrimination
that infected New Deal programs as a result of negotiations, which survives in
the exclusion of farmworkers from FLSA maximum hour and overtime provisions).

al Domestic Workers Alliance study, 36 percent of live-in workers
reported being threatened, insulted, or verbally abused within the
previous twelve months.239 One worker, Etelbina Hauser, revealed
that her bosses consistently groped her, exposed themselves, or
asked for sex.240 “He wanted sexual services. I wanted to get my
payment back, the money that was owed to me . . . I didn’t know
where [to turn for help]. That’s why I’m saying, we are invisible.”241
Domestic workers also may have special visas that allow
them to work in the United States, often to escape poverty and
earn money to send to their families.242 These workers are often
physically and sexually abused, and might even be victims of trafficking.243 However, these workers might not report their abuse
for fear of losing employment by their sponsors and revocation of
their visas.244 In United States v. Alzanki, for example, a domestic
worker from Sri Lanka with a B-1 visa was threatened, prevented
from leaving the residence, deprived of her passport, assaulted, and
threatened with deportation, among other acts.245
Many of the same gaps in protection also deprive farmworkers of protections against discrimination.246 Agricultural work is

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

similarly isolated, and many farmworkers are immigrants.247 Their
overall status and intersecting identities makes them particularly
vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse while at work, and general laws concerning battery or fault fail to adequately protect them
from harm. Not every incident will give rise to a crime, and there
is no guarantee of protection against retaliation for reporting such
instances, particularly if the employee is not a union member.
2.

Solutions

The best way to address gaps in the law is, of course, to fill
them. The ideal solution would be to eradicate requirements for
the number of employees an employer must hire before federal protections can be triggered. Additionally, changes to whether
independent contractors are covered under Title VII could affect
certain types of domestic workers. Currently, more progressive
states are the most probable outlet for effecting such changes due
to the composition of Congress. States like New York provide protections specifically for domestic workers and workers traditionally
not covered under federal antidiscrimination laws that might well
be applied to hold abusive and discriminatory employers accountable for some of the more severe instances of workplace sexual
harassment and assault.248
Since it is not likely that comprehensive immigration reform
will occur in the near future based upon the numerous recent failures to reach a consensus, one other potential temporary solution is
to permit domestic workers who rely on a visa to maintain their visa
if they leave their sponsoring employer due to some sort of physical
or sexual abuse, or if they lose their employment with their sponsor simply because they report such abuse. Although it would not
address all instances of workplace harassment, providing expansive
retaliation protections for workers who file tort claims or criminal
complaints with law enforcement officials would also be helpful.
Additionally, establishing clear tort or other claims for harassment
might be a sufficient stopgap measure until more comprehensive
changes are enacted.

III. Decreased Bargaining Power as Individuals
and the Simultaneous Attack on Unions
A.

Background

Unions have the potential to represent low-wage workers’
interests in collective bargaining agreements, as well as advocate
for legislative policies that protect workers’ rights. In the wake of
#MeToo, unions have worked with employers to effect changes in
the workplace, and have worked with legislatures across the country to pass ordinances to keep employees safe from harassment
and discrimination in the workplace.249 Unions such as UNITE
HERE have been leaders in advocating for low-wage workers, particularly casino and hospitality workers who are often subject to
extreme instances of sexual harassment by customers.250 For example, UNITE HERE Local 1 helped to pass a Chicago ordinance
requiring hotels to equip employees with panic buttons, among
other preventative measures.251 UNITE HERE has also been
working with individual employers to effect change. Just last year,
the union led a strike against Marriott hotels, not only to protest
the hotel chain’s subpar wages and health care, but also to pressure
Marriott to provide housekeepers with panic buttons.252 Without
a unified voice, low-wage workers might find it more difficult to
advance workplace policies that protect workers from harassment.
However, laws limiting unions’ effectiveness and ability to organize
prevent workers from being able to assert their voices to the greatest extent possible.
Low-wage employees in particular have less bargaining
power against employers for several reasons, including the threat
of unemployment, perceived replaceability, and lack of knowledge
about their rights. This unequal bargaining power is exacerbated
without the power of a union, which serves as a unit for negotiating collective bargaining agreements.253 Currently, American union

membership is at its lowest level since the Great Depression, further fueling income inequality in the United States.254 This Article
will focus on current laws and their effects on unions’ ability to
effectively organize, disproportionately leaving low-wage workers
unable to negotiate better work conditions that protect workers
from sexual harassment.
Although globalization is often cited to explain the decrease
in union membership, a similar decrease has not occurred in many
European countries.255 One of the many factors that sets America
apart from its European counterparts is the Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act).256 The Taft-Hartley Act
amended the National Labor Relations Act to prevent unions from
committing unfair labor practices, such as coercion or intimidation
in forming a union or holding union elections. In practice, however, the Taft-Hartley Act simply limits the power of unions through
provisions protecting employers’ free speech, prohibiting secondary boycotts, and permitting the adoption of right-to-work laws,
among others.257
Despite the misleading nomenclature, right-to-work laws provide that workers who do not wish to join a union need not pay
what are called agency, or fair share, fees to the union, even though
unions are still required by law to represent these individuals.258
These laws essentially allow workers to reap all union benefits without paying.259 This situation inherently leads to decreased resources
to collectively bargain. Since the Taft-Harley Act was passed, twenty-eight states have adopted right-to-work laws, either by statute or
constitutional amendment.260 However, after the Missouri legisla254. Id.

ture passed such a statute in 2017, voters defeated the legislation in
a referendum.261
In regard to public sector unions, the recent Janus v. AFSCME delivered a huge blow to public sector workers.262 In Janus, the
Supreme Court overturned Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,
holding that it was a violation of the First Amendment for government employers to require workers who did not wish to be a part
of a union to pay fair share fees.263 Previously, Abood had stricken
a balance that permitted labor unions to charge fair share fees, provided that those fees were not used for any political or ideological
purposes.264 However, the Supreme Court held that avoiding free
riders was not a compelling interest such that it could uphold the
alleged First Amendment violation.265 This holding has a similar
effect as right-to-work laws in the private sector.
There are also many workers who are not guaranteed the
right to organize, including farmworkers and domestic workers; in
fact, they are explicitly excluded from the National Labor Relations
Act.266 Despite this lack of protection, nonprofit organizations such
as Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Farmworker Justice have
been doing vital work to advocate with and on behalf of workers.
Farmworkers and domestic workers have been fighting state by
state to end bans on organizing.267 However, in many states, these
workers are still do not have the guaranteed right to organize.

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

131

Solutions

There is no simple solution for ensuring unions regain strength.
Of course, repealing right-to-work statutes and constitutional
amendments, repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, and reversing Janus
would increase unions’ ability to organize. However, it is highly
unlikely that Congress will act to repeal any portion of Taft-Hartley,
and given the current composition of the Supreme Court and the
recentness of Janus, reversal of the decision at any point in the near
future is highly improbable.
One solution is to focus on private sector attacks by states that
have passed right-to-work statutes or constitutional amendments.
Although it is unlikely that right-to-work statutes or constitutional
amendments could be repealed in every state, stories like those of
Missouri provide a sense of optimism that perhaps the labor movement could work to repeal right-to-work laws.268 Another solution
might involve advocacy on behalf of organized workers to effect
change in the workplace, similar to UNITE HERE’s work on panic
button ordinances that allow hospitality workers to immediately
seek help should guests expose themselves or touch housekeepers inappropriately.269 The Chicago ordinance requires hotels
to adopt written policies regarding harassment by a guest, allow
workers to request reassignment to prevent interactions with an
offending guest, and provide paid time off to report incidents to
law enforcement.270 Perhaps these efforts could help unions garner
support, both with lawmakers and the general public. However,
this advocacy is certainly more difficult to accomplish with diminished resources.
In regard to farmworkers and domestic workers, including
them as employees in the National Labor Relations Act would be
ideal. However, for now, it is up to states to extend these rights to
protect their workers. States should follow California’s lead. California was the first state to establish collective bargaining rights
for farmworkers following advocacy by agricultural workers, who
fought tooth and nail just to gain the right to organize.271 States
must continue to extend these rights to workers.

IV. Status Barriers
A.

Background

Undocumented persons are, of course, more likely to be lowwage workers.272 However, it is unclear whether undocumented
immigrants are entitled to protections under Title VII. Based on
the current composition of the courts and prior case law, a court is
unlikely to find that an undocumented immigrant could avail herself of Title VII protections.273 In Egbuna v. Time-Life Libraries, the
Fourth Circuit held that an employee could not file a Title VII claim
for corroborating another employee’s allegations of sexual harassment because he was an undocumented immigrant.274 The Fourth
Circuit explained that qualification for the job was not to be determined by capacity to complete the job, but rather by whether the
employee was authorized to work in the United States at the time
of the alleged incident.275 In its opinion, the Fourth Circuit distinguished SureTan, Inc. v. NLRB, a Supreme Court decision holding
that an undocumented immigrant could sue an employer for unfair
labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
SureTan, Inc. predated the Immigration and Nationality Act’s
criminalization of hiring undocumented workers.276 The Supreme
Court has since held that an undocumented immigrant can no longer sue an employer for unfair labor practices under the NLRA.277
Although these Supreme Court cases deal with the NLRA, they
are informative in determining whether an individual may be considered an employee under other labor and employee protection
statutes, including Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act.

circuit has already declined to uphold these rights, it would be beneficial for Congress to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act
or Title VII itself to address the conflict the Supreme Court has
interpreted between the Immigration and Nationality Act’s criminalization of hiring unauthorized aliens and worker protection
statutes.278 Although crime victims may obtain U visas, it is far from
a perfect solution because this process is onerous, undocumented
immigrants might be unaware and unable to obtain counsel, there
is still a risk of deportation, and harassment does not always rise to
the level of a crime.279 Congress must pass legislation to ensure that
undocumented workers who report harassment are not only protected under the law, but will also not risk deportation. Otherwise,
undocumented immigrants, many of whom are low-wage workers,
will continue to be exploited fear reporting their assailants and
harassers. These severely unequal power dynamics are currently
ripe for abusers and harassers to take advantage.

Access to Justice Concerns

A.

Lack of Legal Representation
1.

Background

Access to justice for low-income individuals is a major concern within our legal system. That concern, of course, includes
low-wage workers who face sexual harassment and discrimination
in the workplace. In general, low-income individuals receive inadequate or no legal assistance for 86 percent of civil legal problems
they face.280 Although the Supreme Court has declined to categorically require representation for those who cannot afford it in the
types of civil cases it has reviewed, it has not ruled out the possibility that due process might require representation in certain
cases.281 The extent to which Turner and Lassiter, which provide
that appointment of counsel might be required by due process
under certain circumstances, would support the right to counsel is

unclear.282 However, it is unlikely that any blanket right to counsel
would exist in cases involving workplace discrimination, particularly since case law has well established that there is no constitutional
right to employment.
In combination with this lack of a right to counsel in civil
cases, organizations that provide pro bono legal assistance to indigent clients, including those funded through the Legal Services
Corporation (LSC),283 are underfunded and overburdened. The
LSC estimated that out of one million low-income Americans it
would serve in 2017, it could only fully address the legal needs of
about half.284 Additionally, it found that a lack of available resources accounted for between 85 and 97 percent of civil legal issues that
LSC–funded organizations do not fully address.285
Without the ability to afford counsel, and without a guaranteed right to counsel, low-income workers might not feel confident
filing claims pro se, and might experience a heightened fear of
retaliation or some other consequence. Professor Russell Engler
concluded that “[t]he greater the power opposing a litigant, and
the more that a litigant lacks power, the greater will be the need
for representation.”286 Certainly, a low-income employee who
lacks bargaining power filing a claim against a powerful employer,
particularly a large company, would most benefit from legal representation. Even if these employees do file claims pro se, they might
miss important procedural or substantive requirements involved in
bringing a discrimination claim.287
In discrimination claims, the EEOC or state fair employment
practices agencies may litigate cases consistent with the public
interest.288 For example, recently, the EEOC has filed a number of
lawsuits against major employers for harassment on numerous bases.289 However, agencies can only pursue a limited number of cases.

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

In fiscal year 2017, the EEOC only filed lawsuits for 107 out of the
59,466 Title VII claims it received.290
In addition to the potential cost of legal representation, access
to legal representation might also be affected by perceived capacity,
language barriers, and access to information, among countless other
factors.291 Lack of access to legal representation also affects, and is
inherently intertwined with, every previously discussed barrier to
justice for low-wage workers. For example, lack of representation
might lead a worker to sign an unfair arbitration or nondisclosure
agreement, to be unaware that he or she is misclassified, or to fear
retaliation on a more extensive level.

Solutions

The best manner of addressing the lack of adequate, or
any, legal representation is to invest more resources in broadening access to it, whether in enforcement agencies, pro bono legal
organizations, or other branches of government tasked with representation in such matters. Even if the Supreme Court were to
hold that representation was required in civil cases regarding workplace discrimination, investment would be required to ensure that
representation not only existed but was also adequate. After all,
in criminal cases, in which an attorney is constitutionally required,
there has been major controversy over the adequacy of such representation, the lack of resources, and standards for workload

limits.292 State and federal legislatures would essentially need to (1)
mandate representation and (2) allocate resources to ensure adequate representation.
Another solution to the lack of adequate representation
would be to promote unionization and prevent its decline. One of
the benefits of having a union is that it must provide fair representation in grievance processes incorporated in the collective bargaining
agreement to all members of the bargaining unit, although the
union has discretion in terms of whether it provides an attorney
for the grievant.293 Assuming the union is the exclusive bargaining
representative of a particular unit, this right to fair representation
applies regardless of whether a member of the bargaining unit is a
union member.294 Therefore, low-wage workers would receive representation, potentially legal in nature if the union determines that
to be necessary, in filing a complaint against an employer for sexual
harassment in the workplace.
Finally, as previously mentioned, permitting collective and
action against employers might allow low-wage workers to attract
representation; otherwise, their cases are typically not considered
lucrative.295 However, permitting predispute mandatory individual arbitration agreements as a condition of employment hampers
that possibility. Essentially, many of the factors that would improve
conditions for workers would also provide greater access to legal
representation.

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

Evidentiary and Credibility Concerns
1.

Background

Although plaintiffs need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence, there are several evidentiary and
credibility hurdles that plaintiffs must overcome to successfully
argue their case without immediate dismissal or summary judgment. First, harassment does not always occur when witnesses or
present, it is not always documented in an email, and it is typically no longer so outright that there is no question the animus was
due to discrimination of an employee’s protected status. Second,
in hostile work environment actions, not only do employees need
to prove that harassment was “severe or pervasive,” but employers are also provided with several defenses that would be simple to
conjure.296 Third, juries and judges alike simply might not find individuals who come forward to be credible. In addition to the fact
that preconceived biases and beliefs might make women seem less
credible, particularly to male jurors,297 victims of harassment might
experience trauma or develop other mental health conditions that
affect their ability to linearly, coherently, and consistently recount
facts;298 victims might be people of color, leading to additional questions of credibility by white judges and jurors;299 and victims might
296. See Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 67 (1986) (establishing the severe or pervasive standard). The defenses available differ based
upon whether the claim is quid pro quo or hostile work environment, or whether it involves another employee or a supervisor. See 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(d)
(2018) (stating that an employer is liable for harassment by a coworker if it
knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to take “immediate
and appropriate corrective action); Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.
775, 807–08 (1998) (holding an employer can escape vicarious liability for harassment absent tangible employment action by a supervisor if the employer
can demonstrate that (1) it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct
promptly any sexually harassing behavior” and (2) “the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise”).

have physical, psychiatric, intellectual, or other disabilities—whether a result of the harassment or even one factor contributing to the
harassment—leading judges and jurors to inappropriately question
or assess their credibility due to misconceptions about disability
or due to the manner in which the victim describes the events,300
among a host of other challenges.
2.

Solutions

In regard to the issue of lack of witnesses and implicit discrimination, the answers lie in the manner in which judges and
juries assess facts and credibility and apply legal standards. Elizabeth Tippett argues that judges may begin to apply the “severe or
pervasive” standard, as well as the Faragher defense in regard to
employer reasonableness in preventing discrimination, in a manner
that is more favorable to employees in light of #MeToo.301 Tippett
hopes these applications will, at the very least, prevent an almost
immediate grant of summary judgment for employers.302 Although
entirely possible, that certainly will not, and has not, occurred overnight. One judge’s idea of what is reasonable is highly subjective
and variable. However, judges must evolve regarding their notions
as to what is reasonable or potentially reasonable so as to warrant
a jury trial on a genuine issue of material fact.
In regard to credibility, it is paramount that plaintiffs actually
have their claims heard by a jury of their peers. The law prohibits exclusion from jury service based upon race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, or economic status.303 Even still, (1) juries lack the
necessary diversity due to the barriers involved in serving on a
jury304 and (2) judges may still often dismiss claims or enter summacourtroom exclusion of people of color and its impact on credibility determinations).

Sexual Harassment of Low-Wage Workers

ry judgment even before a jury trial occurs. Ensuring that diverse
judges sit on the bench is therefore of utmost importance—that
includes women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities,
people of color, and so many other disenfranchised identities.305

Conclusion
There are a number of barriers that prevent low-wage workers from asserting rights under Title VII. Not only do these workers
struggle to assert their rights, but they are also far more likely to
experience sexual or other forms of harassment in the workplace
due to their status.306 However, the media has largely focused on
harassment in white collar employment, such as in the upper echelons of the entertainment industry. Although the media should
certainly shed light on the experiences of women in the entertainment and other white-collar industries, it has largely failed to
highlight low-wage industry women’s traumatic and severe experiences of harassment.
Women of a similar stature to Gwyneth Paltrow who accused
Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, are protected because
they have the means to accuse harassers without fear of retaliation,
excessive legal fees, liquidated damages for violating any nondisclosure agreement, or other barriers.307 In that sense, the protection
is, frankly, more extralegal than legal in nature; the protection is in
Paltrow’s and similarly situated actress’, access to funds, high profile, and media following. Low-wage workers do not benefit from
such extralegal protections. Not only that, but low-wage workers
might even be in the United States illegally, independent contractors, domestic workers, or other types of workers for whom Title
VII does not apply. Our current laws fail to protect the women who
require these shields the most, making their purpose and application far too limited.

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

Vol. 26.69

Certain barriers impact low-wage workers disproportionately
in pursuing claims for sexual harassment in the workplace: mandatory individual arbitration clauses; nondisclosure agreements;
misclassification of workers and increased use of independent contractors; the need for adequate, or any, legal representation; fear of
retaliation; the lack of protections for domestic workers and farmworkers; the lack of protections for immigrants who have entered
the United States illegally; and legislative attacks on the right to
organize. The United States must continue to ensure that the law
works for all women, not simply celebrities or those with the means
to protect themselves without the cushion of the law, by filling gaps
in protections and coverage of preexisting statutes, as well as by
codifying new protections, such as those regarding arbitration and
nondisclosure agreements, that would allow low-wage workers to
seek justice in the workplace. Until Congress takes effective action,
it is up to states to enact more expansive protections for working
people, even if it is not clear that they have the authority to do so
based on federal preemption.
Of course, who sits on the courts matters. The merits of the
opinions delivered in decisions such as Epic Systems and Janus may
be debated by reasonable persons; any difference in the composition
of the Supreme Court might have led to an outcome that would be
more protective of low-wage workers, and workers generally. However, given the unlikelihood that any progressive change will come
from the highest court at this time, it is up to Congress to legislate,
and to make its intentions patently clear should the legislation be
challenged. It is also up to society to change its views about low-wage
workers. The court of public opinion and change in societal norms
and expectations can very well impact not only legislators, but also
who sits on the courts. If we continue to see low-wage workers in the
same way as these harassers in the workplace do—other, meaningless, exploitable, inhuman—it is unlikely we will make any progress.
The #MeToo movement has created a moment with the power to
amplify the voices of low-wage workers who have long been speaking their truths and fighting for fairer workplaces.
It is up to allies to work with low-wage workers and amplify their voices. Simply permitting activists like Monica Ramirez
of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and other activists to walk the
red carpet following their efforts to express solidarity with Hollywood is not enough.308 Without the voices of low-wage workers in
the forefront of this movement, it will be impossible to effect changes necessary to protect all women—not just the women at the top.
