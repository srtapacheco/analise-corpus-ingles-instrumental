Perhaps the most important of the many 50th anniversaries
marked in 2014 was the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 (Title VII).1 Title VII greatly broadened the ability of individuals to gain and keep employment by barring discrimination
based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.2 The anniversary is a good time to consider what has been accomplished and
the necessary next steps. Although much progress has been made,
there is still much to be done, especially with regard to the advancement of working women with children.

years earlier by the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483
(1954), which overruled the separate-but-equal doctrine and enabled equal access to education. The two main pillars for a decent life in the U.S. were seen to
be an education and a job. Brown enabled the former and, ten years later, Title
VII was seen as enabling the latter. Other 50th anniversaries in 2014 include

Part I of this manuscript briefly reviews the effectiveness of
Title VII, examining judicial interpretations of the statute as well as
additional legislation and regulations adopted to further its implementation. Part II contains an analysis of our empirical study addressing whether employees’ cultural similarity with leaders in their
organization is related to obtaining and benefiting from mentors and
networks, and how gender influences this dynamic. Specifically, we
examine whether sharing cultural similarity with the organization’s
leaders is especially important for married women and women with
dependents to overcome negative stereotypes. We offer proposals
for reform in Part III, followed by our concluding remarks.
I. Title VII: Effectiveness
Title VII’s protections against employment discrimination
have significantly impacted opportunities for women.3 In 1963,
the year before the law’s passage, women comprised 38 percent of
the workforce.4 Married women comprised less than a third of the
general workforce in 1960.5 Even fewer women with children were
employed.6 Moreover, women were effectively excluded from most
better-paid and powerful positions prior to 1964.7 More recent data
suggests a radically changed landscape: in 2012, women made up
58 percent of the workforce, a 53 percent increase from 1963.8 Furthermore, the labor force of working mothers has grown by 30 percent, from 54.4 percent in 1962 to 70.5 percent in 2012.9 Women,
however, still face significant barriers in reaching top leadership
positions, where they are dramatically underrepresented. This is
especially true with regard to women with children.

Of course, cultural and social changes such as the Women’s Movement
also had an impact. See, e.g., Robert C. Bird, More Than a Congressional Joke:

Rights Act, 3 Wm. & Mary J. Women & L. 137, 146-50 (1997).

A.

Women in the Workforce: The Data
Although there are a number of high-profile women in powerful leadership positions, gender discrimination10 and the glass ceiling are still firmly in place. This is evidenced by the large number of
discrimination suits brought by women plaintiffs against employers,
the dearth of women in top leadership positions, and disparities in
salary. In 2013, 46 percent of women surveyed said they had faced
gender discrimination in the workplace.11 Furthermore, the situation is not improving. These figures are little-changed from a 1997
survey and only slightly better than data from 2000.12 In 2012, a record number of Title VII sex discrimination cases were filed.13 The
situation is worse in some industries than in others. Women face
more discrimination in male-dominated, higher-paid professions.
For example, the technology industry has recently come under attack for the low number of women in the industry,14 the “boorish”
behavior often suffered by those women who are in the industry,15
The EEOC defines sex discrimination as treating someone unfavorably
based on the person’s sex, but can include treating someone unfavorably based
on his or her connection with an organization or group that is generally associated with people of a certain sex. Additionally, sex discrimination also includes
gender identity discrimination, usually against transgender individuals. SexBased Discrimination, U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, http://www.eeoc.

This issue was recently brought into sharp focus when the CEO of Microsoft, speaking to a meeting celebrating and advocating for women in computing, stated that women should just trust in the system and do not need to ask
for raises; good karma will take care of them. This incident occurred despite

and the lack of funding for women entrepreneurs. Similar complaints are made about the financial sector, where fewer than 20
percent of executives and directors are women, and no women lead
the 20 largest securities firms and banks.17 An examination of the
legal profession also shows significant disparities. Although women
make up 45.4 percent of associates in the nation’s major law firms,18
they make up only 17 percent of equity partners at the 200 largest law firms.19 Women partners may also command less for their
work.20 Only 14 percent of senior executives at Fortune 500 companies are women, and this figure has remained unchanged for a
decade.21 Even worse, women account for only 4.4 percent of CEOs
of Fortune 500 companies today.22 Although women are quickly

compared to 5.677 percent for white males).

breaching the gender gap in small business ownership and entrepreneurship, only about 19 percent of business owners in America
in 2015 were women.23 Political leadership is similarly lopsided:
fewer than 100 women are members of Congress,24 and fewer than
30 percent of all state legislators are women.25
This lack of women in leadership is not a problem of supply. By 2014, 88.9 percent of women had completed high school or
more, in contrast with 87.7 percent of men.26 In the same year, about
32 percent of both women and men had completed four years of
college or more.27 Furthermore, more women than men have received a graduate education.28 In 2014, 9 percent of women held a
master’s degree or higher, in contrast to 6 percent of men.29

degrees earned a median of $931 weekly, compared to the men’s

degrees received $1,411 to men’s $1,896. Overall, in 2013 women’s
median weekly salary was $706 to men’s $860.33 The earnings ratio
of women to men in the U.S. is 80.9 percent.34 Furthermore, the
percentage of wage and salary workers with earnings at or below
the prevailing federal minimum wage is almost double for women
as compared to men.35 The pay gap is even greater for women with
children. The “motherhood wage penalty” is as much as 5 percent
per child, and motherhood is a significant risk factor for poverty.36
Since women are now the primary or co-primary wage earners in
almost two-thirds of families, such disparities have a broad impact
on children as well.37 The disparity persists even though women
account for 51 percent of all those employed in management, professional, or related occupations.38
The cited statistics show that the employment playing field
is still not level. This is true despite the repeated expansion and
enhancement of protection under Title VII during the fifty years
since its passage.

Expansion of the Coverage of Title VII

Protecting Racial Minorities
Title VII has been interpreted and reinterpreted to expand
its coverage, contributing significantly to improvements in women’s
employment.39 The first expansions, however, involved race discrimination cases, with cases centering on women following several
years later. Perhaps the most significant ruling on Title VII was
delivered by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Griggs v.
Duke Power Company.40 When passed, most believed that Title VII

only prohibited intentional discrimination. In Griggs, the Court
greatly expanded the reach of Title VII by adopting the theory of
disparate impact. In doing so, the Court acknowledged that Title
VII was not achieving its intended purpose of giving all people a
fair chance at employment. The Court noted that in Title VII, Congress required the removal of “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary
barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to
discriminate . . . on the basis of impermissible classifications.”41 Further, the Court stated that “absence of discriminatory intent does
not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that
operate as “built-in head winds [against protected groups].”42
As a result of the ruling, when a plaintiff establishes that a facially neutral rule or policy produces a relevant numerical disparity
for a protected group (an “adverse impact”), the burden of proof
shifts to the employer to show that the selection device producing the adverse impact was both job-related and necessary.43 This
was a significant development in favor of protected groups claiming
discrimination under Title VII.44 For example, height and weight
requirements—which were routinely used pre-Griggs to select for
positions such as firefighters, police officers, and physical therapists,
and which worked to keep most women and some minorities out of
those jobs—now could not be used unless employers could prove
such requirements were job-related and necessary; most could not.45
The 1978 EEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (“UGESP”) establish a method to identify whether the adverse impact required for a disparate impact analysis exists.46 According to this method, adverse impact exists if members
of a protected class are selected at a rate of less than 80 percent of
Id. at 431.
Id. at 432.
43
Over time, the courts have become more sophisticated about statistical
analysis, and showing the required numerical disparity has become more difficult. See, e.g., Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 997 (1988); Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440 (1982).
44
See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).
45
See, e.g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977); EEOC v. Dial Corp.,
469 F.3d 735 (8th Cir. 2006). In Dial, the employer’s use of a strength test was
found to be in violation of Title VII because only 15 percent of women were
hired after its implementation compared to the 46 percent prior to its use. This
represented nearly ten standard deviations, a number much greater than the
two or three standard deviations found to be statistically significant in prior
cases. The EEOC rejected the employer’s defense that the test was designed to
reduce injuries. It found that the test was considerably more difficult than the
job.

the selection rate of another group. This approach has been criticized by the courts, which often use a different formula, designating an adverse impact where the difference between the number of
members of the protected class selected and the number that would
be anticipated in a random selection is more than two or three standard deviations apart.48
The Guidelines also provide advice to employers on how to
determine whether their tests and other selection criteria are lawful. The tests and selection criteria must be “job-related and consistent with business necessity.”49 Therefore, an employer may rebut a
prima facie case of disparate impact by a showing that the particular test is specific to the job and consistent with business necessity.
50
Nonetheless, even if the employer can satisfy both prongs of the
test, the plaintiff may yet prevail if she can demonstrate that a less
discriminatory alternative is available.51
The next important development in disparate impact under
Title VII arrived in the case of Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust.52
In Watson, a bank teller who was a Black woman was passed over
many times for a promotion. The employer was able to show that,
in each instance, subjective discretionary criteria were used to select someone else. All prior cases had challenged only objective criteria that applied to all but resulted in a disproportionate adverse
impact.53 In this case, the Supreme Court held that disparate impact could be established by showing that subjective criteria led to
disproportionate results. The Court therefore acknowledged that,
without so holding, the Griggs/disparate impact theory could be

Law 90-91 (Paul W. Cane, Jr. et al., eds., 3d ed. 1996). When analyzing unscored
objective criteria, the Uniform Guidelines have generally found educational requirements that have a disparate impact unlawful. The higher the professional
requirements, the lower the burden on the employer to show job-relatedness.

avoided by using both subjective and objective selection criteria.54
Thus, the burden was now on employers to justify the legitimacy of
its subjective criteria.55
Congress reaffirmed the importance of the disparate impact
theory when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Eighteen years
after Griggs, in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Antonio a more politically conservative Supreme Court shifted the burden of proof back
to the employee to show that the employer’s means of employee
selection were not job-related, thereby significantly increasing the
burden on the plaintiff.56 Congress reacted by passing the Civil
Rights Act of 1991, which codified disparate impact and the employer’s burden of proof, restoring it to its pre-Wards Cove status
and enabling discrimination cases in other ways.57
The Supreme Court adopted its most radical interpretation
of Title VII with regard to affirmative action on behalf of African-Americans in United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO v. Weber, where the Court cited the “spirit” of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
rather than its language prohibiting discrimination.58 Eight years
after Weber, the Supreme Court recognized that white women were
also entitled to the benefits of affirmative action.59 In Johnson, a
county transportation department followed a voluntarily adopted
affirmative action plan, and promoted a woman over a man who
had scored slightly higher on a promotion exam. The plan, adopted to advance minorities and women in areas in which they were
“We are persuaded that our decisions in Griggs and succeeding cases
could largely be nullified if disparate impact analysis were applied only to standardized-selection practices.” Id. at 989.

It is not sufficient, however, to just prove numerical disparity. See 42

the American Dream for so long,’ constituted the first legislative prohibition of
all voluntary, private, race-conscious efforts to abolish traditional patterns of
racial segregation and hierarchy.”) (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (statement of Sen. Humphrey)). The Court upheld a voluntarily-adopted affirmative
action plan in private employment that was challenged under Title VII. Weber
was decided the year after Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265

underrepresented, considered being female a plus factor. This plan
was approved in situations where there was a manifest imbalance.
The Court noted that no jobs were set aside for women and that no
men were automatically excluded.60
The general affirmative action interpretation has gradually
been narrowed over time in subsequent court decisions. This has
primarily been done through the requirement of ever-better statistical evidence, in combination with a heightened showing of necessity when the case involves government selection through preference for a protected category.61 Additionally, several states have
passed legislation prohibiting affirmative action in the public sector.62 In the latest Supreme Court case involving affirmative action,
Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and
Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by any Means Necessary
(BAMN), the Court effectively upheld a Michigan constitutional
amendment prohibiting affirmative action in employment, education, and contracting, by finding that there was no authority in the
U.S. Constitution allowing judges to set aside such amendments.63
Despite the narrowing of its use, affirmative action, particularly in
the private employment sector, is still allowed.

Expanding Protection for Women
Because sex was added as a protected category to Title VII at
the last minute in an attempt to kill its passage, there is virtually no
legislative history addressing this element of the Act. The courts and
the EEOC, the administrative body charged with enforcement of
Title VII, have therefore been freer to decide the legislation’s scope.

In general, protections have been expanded over time. Courts’ recognition that Title VII encompassed sexual harassment suits was
yet another significant development for women in the workplace.64
Prior to this, many argued that harassment was not gender discrimination within the purview of Title VII because women could harass
men as much as men could harass women.65 Eventually, the Court
again expanded protection and recognized two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo and the harassing environment.66 The theoretical basis for quid pro quo harassment was recognition of the
power differential between men and women in both the workplace
and society, and men in supervisory positions taking advantage of
that power to extract sexual favors in exchange for a job benefit.67
Different levels of proof, however, are required for burden shifting
because the former was considered worse than the latter.68
Another expansion occurred in the case of Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins.69 Hopkins was denied partnership in the accounting
firm even though she was highly rated for her accounting skills
and her “rainmaking” abilities.70 In an effort to help her become
a partner in the next round of considerations, she was advised to
dress and speak in a more stereotypically feminine manner. When
she sued for sex discrimination, the firm argued that she was not
made a partner because of personality problems, including being
64
The first case to recognize sexual harassment under Title VII was Williams v. Saxbe, 413 F. Supp. 654 (D.D.C. 1976), vacated on other grounds sub
nom. Williams v. Bell, 587 F.2d 1240 (D.C. Cir. 1978). See also Barnes v. Costle,

could collect for assault and battery for the most severe form of harassment,
others argued it should not be included within Title VII. That almost all sexual
harassment was by men harassing women was not considered dispositive.

68
Discrimination based on a harassing environment, which can be done
by coworkers and third parties as well as supervisors, generally requires a repeated pattern. It is based on the power of the employers to control the work
environment and their failure to control it, such that a harassing environment is
permitted to exist. The Court looked to agency law (and the EEOC) to impose
liability. For harassing environment cases, the Supreme Court created a safe
harbor for employers by allowing them to avoid liability by putting in place
procedures to educate about and prohibit such actions, and establish meaningful procedures to report and investigate claims, and punish wrongdoers. Vinson,

too abrasive toward staff. The fractured majority held that Hopkins could sue in her “mixed motive” case, which included legitimate reasons to deny partnership (negative personality traits) and
discriminatory reasons (gender-based stereotypes). Hopkins met
her burden of proof by showing the latter was a “motivating” factor
in the decision.72 In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress included
the motivating factor in the statute.73
Many of the additional gender-related decisions and Title VII

problems have not been dealt with adequately.

while Title VII prohibited discrimination based on sex, it did not
include pregnancy discrimination.76 The Court determined that

discriminatory because it distinguished between pregnant persons
and non-pregnant persons and included both men and women in
the latter group.77 Congress reacted to this decision by amending
Title VII in 1978 through passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA),78 thereby acknowledging that Title VII was not
adequately protecting women from discrimination on the basis of
pregnancy, motherhood, and perceptions related thereto.79 The Act
states that an employer cannot discriminate against his or her employee on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical issues.80 Accordingly, any pregnancy-related medical conditions must
be treated in the same way as any temporary illness or condition.81
Unfortunately, despite this amendment, courts have routinely
interpreted the PDA in a restrictive manner.82 Some treat pregnancy
as a disability that is chosen, because women can control becoming
pregnant. Hence courts have seen fit to provide pregnant women
with less protection than those with other, non-chosen disabilities.
Other courts have held that the PDA only prohibits discriminatory
animus against pregnant women.83 Thus, sex-neutral policies that
disproportionately affect pregnant women may not be remedied.
Furthermore, because the PDA does not entirely prohibit the termination of pregnant employees, if the employer believes that the
cost of an employee’s maternity leave is more than that employee is
“worth,” then termination may not constitute unlawful discrimination.84 Many of these restrictive interpretations may be made moot
by the EEOC’s new guidelines.

ance focuses on the PDA and the Americans with Disabilities Act
(“ADA”). The Guidance represents the first time since 1983 that
the EEOC has taken an official position interpreting the PDA,86
and a number of its interpretations are controversial.
The Guidance favors a broad approach to interpretation of
the PDA. For example, it concludes that the PDA prohibits discrimination against not only presently pregnant women, but also
those who have been pregnant in the past or who have the intention to become pregnant.87 Furthermore, discrimination based on
stereotypes and assumptions about a pregnant woman’s capabilities is unlawful under the Guidance’s interpretation, even when
the employer believes it is acting in the employee’s or the child’s
best interests. One example of this is excluding a pregnant woman
from handling toxic chemicals. This reflects the decision in UAW v.
Johnson Controls, where the court barred an employer from using
a policy that prohibited any employee who could become pregnant
from working in jobs where they may be exposed to substances potentially harmful to a fetus.88 These jobs were some of the highest
paying and therefore desirable to the plaintiffs, none of whom were
pregnant or planned on getting pregnant. The PDA was an important factor in the Court not allowing a classification based on
potential for pregnancy, which contrasts with its pre-PDA decision
in Gilbert.89
In a major change, the Guidance interprets the phrase “related medical condition” to include lactation.90 If an employer allows
sick leave or a change of schedules for employees with non-incapacitating medical conditions, the same options should be available
for lactating employees.
The most controversial position in the Guidance is that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions
86
There have been numerous conflicting interpretations of the PDA in case
law. Compare Hall v. Nalco Co., 534 F.3d 644 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding that discrimination against a female employee because she was seeking fertility treatment is actionable) with EEOC v. Houston Funding II, Ltd., 717 F.3d 425 (5th
Cir. 2013) (holding that lactation discrimination is not covered because lactation is not related to pregnancy).

should be treated in the same manner as those who have similar
abilities and are not affected. Those protected by the PDA should
be entitled to “workplace adjustments similar to accommodations”
provided by the employer for disabled employees.91 In fact, the
source of the limitation, whether pregnancy or disability, is immaterial. What matters is whether the employees have a similar ability
or inability to work. This interpretation was strongly criticized by
EEOC Commissioner Barker, who in her May 2014 memorandum
on the draft guidance, stated that she believes it “allows pregnant
employees to bypass the requirements of a qualified individual with
a disability under the ADA, thus elevating pregnant employees to
a kind of super-status above that of individuals with disabilities.”92
Commissioner Barker argued that the draft guidance did not require a pregnant worker to show that she has a disability under the
ADA to qualify for reasonable accommodations; instead she must
simply “point to an ADA comparator (and arguably even a hypothetical ADA comparator).”93
Another key issue discussed by the Guidance is whether
an employer must provide a pregnant employee with a light-duty assignment to accommodate her pregnancy-related limitation
or incapacity. The Guidance addresses two issues: the “pregnancy-blind” employer policies and the appropriate ways for pregnant
workers to establish a pregnancy discrimination claim under the
PDA.94 The Guidance dictates that an employee “may still establish
a violation of the PDA by showing that she was denied light-duty
or other accommodations that were granted to other employees”
who are as able or unable to work.95 The Guidance clearly states
that employer policies that make light-duty work available only to
employees who suffer an on-the-job injury violate the PDA. The
EEOC argues that these employer policies treat pregnant workers
differently simply because of the source of their limitation.96 Second, the Guidance states that in disparate treatment cases, a pregId.

nant employee may compare herself to employees with disabilities
or on-the-job injuries to establish a prima facie case of pregnancy
discrimination.97
The Guidance also interprets the ADA. Unsurprisingly, the
EEOC acknowledges that pregnancy in itself does not constitute
impairment under the ADA.98 However, the EEOC finds that a
broad range of temporary impairments associated with pregnancy
could qualify as disabilities. The Guidance includes a long list of accommodations that may be necessary when the pregnancy-related
impairments impose substantially limiting work-related restrictions.
In order to address many of the questions left for employers
post-Guidance, the EEOC has created a list of best practices that
could help employers avoid liability under the PDA and the ADA.99
Central to these practices is the need for employers to develop, disseminate, and enforce a strong policy, which includes a process for
addressing accommodation requests by pregnant women.100 An important note is that under the Guidance, parental leave must be offered to similarly situated men and women under the same terms.101
The Guidance was released at a complicated time. Congress
is considering the passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act
(“PWFA”), which could amend the PDA to expressly require employers to grant reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers.102 Furthermore, the Supreme Court was deciding Young v.
UPS103 at the time, which could have contradicted the Guidance in
many ways.
The Supreme Court issued a judgment in Young on March
25, 2015.104 The plaintiff in Young requested light-duty assignments
to accommodate heavy lifting restrictions, but UPS’s policy limited light-duty assignments to employees who (1) have been injured
on the job; (2) had lost their U.S. Department of Transportation
certification; or (3) were disabled under the ADA.105 Young did
not qualify for any of these categories, and her request was deId.

nied. Young did receive an extended leave of absence. The District
Court for the District of Maryland granted summary judgment to
UPS.106 The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed by finding
that UPS’s light-duty policy was pregnancy “neutral” as required
by the PDA.107
Writing for the majority, Justice Breyer found that (1) an
employee can allege unlawful disparate treatment under the PDA
through an application of the McDonnell Douglas108 framework
and (2) the pregnant employee can establish a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether or not the policies impose a significant burden on pregnant employees by showing evidence that
the employer accommodates a large percentage of non-pregnant
workers while failing to do so with pregnant workers.109
The McDonnell framework demands that the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of discrimination by “showing actions
taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions
remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under” Title
VII.110 Therefore, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she belongs to the protected class, she
attempted to obtain accommodations, the employer did not allow
for such accommodations, and the employer accommodated others
“similar in their ability or inability to work.”111 The employer can
justify not accommodating the pregnant employee by relying on
“legitimate, nondiscriminatory” justifications. The reason cannot,
however, be due to the accommodation being more expensive or
less convenient for the employer.112 If the employer does establish
a “legitimate, nondiscriminatory” justification, the employee can
provide “sufficient evidence that the employer’s policies impose
a significant burden on pregnant workers” and the justification is
not strong enough to justify such burden.113 As one commentator
argued, the decision “was a kind of hybrid remedy, judging intentional bias on the one hand and harmful impact on women workers

on the other.” Following the Young ruling, the EEOC issued an
update to the Guidance in June 2015.
Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy occurs at all levels
of an organization.115 Marissa Mayer’s selection as the CEO of Yahoo in 2012 provides an illustration of just how rare a pregnant
CEO is. Ms. Mayer’s appointment made her one of twenty female
CEOs of a Fortune 500 company at the time and the first pregnant
CEO ever included in that list. The board was fully aware of Ms.
Mayer’s pregnancy during the hiring process. Shortly after Yahoo
announced her appointment, Ms. Mayer also publicly announced
her pregnancy.116 Although her appointment as CEO of the struggling tech behemoth was newsworthy for a variety of reasons, it was
her pregnancy that garnered more discussion than anything else.
Her selection also evoked the phenomenon of the “glass cliff,” in
which women are appointed to leadership positions “a disproportionate amount of the time” when an organization is facing a dire
situation.117
In addition, successful women in the labor market are less
likely to be married or have children than others. 118 This is in stark
contrast to men. For example, one study found that 33 percent of
high-achieving women and 49 percent of ultra-achieving women
between 41 and 55 were childless.119 Another study conducted in
2001 found that only half of women working on Wall Street had
children, compared to 74 percent of men.120 The more hours a woman works, the more dissatisfied she is with the demands of employment and family life.121 However, a man’s sense of satisfaction is
not influenced by the hours that he spends at work. Additionally,

women who are very highly educated are less likely to participate in
the workforce after having children.122
Common prejudices against women in the workplace include:
assumptions that women with small children are less productive
or dependable than their counterparts;123 that mothers will not, or
should not, work long hours;124 and that mothers are not committed
to their jobs.125 Women who take leave or use flexible schedules
may also be viewed as less committed to their jobs.126 Discrimination faced by working mothers can be very subtle. While experimental studies have found that women with children are often perceived as warmer, they are also perceived as less competent and
less worthy of institutional rewards.127 Some of the biases against
women as leaders stems from the fact that characteristics associated with leadership are also associated with masculinity.128 These
mismatched associations create conflict between the two sets of expectations. Other experimental studies suggest that female parents
are held to higher performance standards than both male parents

and females that are not parents. “Additional research shows that
this bias may be stronger in the context of family leave.”130
Men can also face discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities. 131 Men may find that employers discourage them
from using time off to take care of children.132 Alternatively, employers may retaliate against men when they return from leave or
deny them leave with the idea that their spouses should take leave
instead. Men who take family leave may also be perceived as less
committed to their job and career. Stereotypes about women’s roles
in the home are reinforced by parallel stereotypes of men’s roles.
These restrictive interpretations “inculcate the cultural stereotypes
and invidious treatment of women who have been, are, or may be
affected by pregnancy or childbirth in their lifetime.”133 Many have
attributed the pay disparities and lack of female leadership not to
bias against women, per se, but to the perception that women have
children and thus are not as committed to their jobs, take more time
out to care for children, and are not as focused.134
Besides familial factors, cultural, social, and organizational
obstacles can limit access to top positions.135 For example, when
leadership positions become available, those doing the selecting,
who are almost always male, tend to select those who are most like
them.136 Additionally, male leaders at the top often have spouses
who do not hold a job outside the home, thus reinforcing another
norm.137 In fact, one study found that compared to men in modern

marriages (where wives are full-time employees), employed husbands in traditional marriages (where the wives are not employed)
tend to view the presence of women in the workplace unfavorably,
perceive organizations with many women employees as running
less smoothly, find organizations with women leaders less attractive, and more frequently deny qualified women employees opportunities for promotion. 138 Furthermore, single men who then marry women who are not employed may become less positive about
women in the workplace.139 Another issue is that women often have
diminished access to experiences that build social capital within an
organization.140
We conducted a multi-year study in an effort to obtain more
insight into this problem. In the study reported here, we examine
the extent to which being like one’s boss is important for women
with children. Additionally, we look at the effect of mentoring and
networking in helping women with children get past the barriers to
leadership positions.
II. The Pathways Study
In this Part, we review previous studies to formulate hypotheses regarding how sharing cultural norms may influence experiences in the workplace. We then analyze survey data to determine
whether sharing a cultural background with those in the highest
level of management at an organization influences career outcomes
for men and women, and whether those outcomes depend on marital status. Finally, we analyze the extent to which sharing a cultural
background with upper management influences career outcomes
for men and women with dependents.

Backdrop: Previous Studies
This section reviews previous studies examining the similarity
of recruits’ and employees’ cultural backgrounds to those of their
employers, and its impact on hiring and promotion decisions. For
selective schools; since elite companies tend to hire from elite schools and
women from elite schools do not remain employed as long, the talent pipeline
is more limited).

example, Kathleen L. McGinn and Katherine L. Milkman examined gender demographics in large law firms, specifically looking
at the interplay between persistent gender disparities at the top of
firms despite a more proportional gender makeup in the entry-level
ranks.141 Law firms’ promotion policies are “up or out,” meaning
that junior associates are required to prove their value to the firm
within a specified time period after being hired.142 Another feature
of the “up or out” policy is that senior professionals decide whether junior professionals move up or move out.143 This results in intense pressure on the associates to “fit in.”144 McGinn and Milkman
studied promotions and departures within these up-or-out firms
and found that a higher proportion of same-sex superiors within
a workgroup decreased a woman’s likelihood of departure and increased the likelihood of a promotion.145 They also found, however,
that higher proportions of same-sex peers within one’s workgroup
increased the likelihood of departure and decreased the likelihood
of promotion.146 This finding diverged from previous research,
which showed that higher proportions of same-sex peers within a
workgroup contributed to social cohesion.147 Instead, McGinn and
Milkman found that putting demographically similar peers in the
same workgroup led to structural marginalization, creating competition within the group.148 The same effects were found for men
and women, suggesting that one perceives one’s chances of success
hampered when one is within the presence of numerous individuals
who are in the same demographic group.149
Allen N. Berger and his coauthors examined how homophily,
the “love of the same,”150 and social ties affect career outcomes in
banking, looking at outsider appointments versus insider appointments to executive boards.151 The authors analyzed the effect of

homophily and social ties, including age, gender, education, and social connections (via employment history) on the appointment of
outsiders, those without previous employment at the bank, versus
insiders.152 They studied the German banking industry from 19932008, using data on nearly 11,000 executive appointments.153 The
authors found age to be an important factor—small differences
in age between the appointed and the members of the executive
board was a considerable factor in whether the appointed was an
outsider.154 That is, an outsider is more likely to be appointed if he
or she is the same generation as the board members.155 A woman
outsider is more likely to be appointed if there are women board
members.156 Social connections also played a role—an outsider is
more likely to be appointed when he or she is in the same social
circle as board members.157
Another study considered hiring in academia, hypothesizing
that recruiters in academia prefer candidates with demographic backgrounds that are similar to their own.158 Prior research
suggested that due to absence of clear evaluation criteria in academia, decision-makers often base their assessments on “alternative criteria.” As a result, candidates with backgrounds, attitudes,
and personalities that are similar to the recruiter’s are often rated
more favorably than other candidates.159 Using recruitment data
on sixty academic departments of business administration in Germany, Heinke Roebken found that similarity and geographic proximity explained recruitment outcomes.160 The data suggested that
the higher the number of ties to a common third department, the
more likely the faculty exchange between the two departments.161
Moreover, the more departments published in similar journals, the
more likely they were to interact.162 Geographic distance between
universities also had an effect on recruitment, with universities located near each other more likely to recruit from one another.163

Roebken also found that departments preferred candidates from
the same or higher status group, indicating that when it is difficult
to evaluate a candidate directly, academic departments may instead
look at the social position of the candidate’s sending institution.164
Christoph Ellersgaard, Anton Larsen, and Martin Munk studied the importance of families, the educational system, and economic organizations on the ability to reach leadership positions in
organizations.165 The authors note the similarity of the social origin
of the top managerial elite, with 4/5 of executives coming from the
top fifth of their society.166 While their social origin is homogenous,
their pathways to the top are heterogeneous. As a result, a business elite exists that is homogenous with regard to age, sex, and
ethnicity.167
A recent Utah State University study found that boards are
more likely to promote women or minority candidates to top leadership positions when the company is in crisis.168 As discussed previously, studies have labeled this phenomenon the “glass cliff.”169
When these companies then decline, the boards are more likely to
replace the diverse executives with white males.170 This suggests
that when companies hire their first female or minority CEO, they
might actually be setting the company on a less diverse track.171
Furthermore, women in the highest positions may face higher performance expectations than men in the same positions.172

Hypotheses
Drawing on social identity and similarity-attraction theories
explored in the above studies, we build arguments for eight hypotheses regarding the significance of sharing a cultural background with
organizational leaders—for both men and women, whether married
or single—for career satisfaction and career success. Additionally,

because access to mentors and networks have been proven to be an
important component to successfully climbing the corporate ladder,173 we also examine whether sharing a cultural background with
those at the top of an organization conferred any advantages on
one gender over the other in the quality of mentoring and networking relationships. Previous research has not examined how gender
and family status (marital and dependents) interact with sharing a
cultural background to influence work-related outcomes. We used
both objective and subjective career success measures (position
and career satisfaction). We could not use salary because a large
portion of the sample did not provide such information. Recent
research suggests that demographic characteristics, such as gender
and marital status, can have differential associations with men’s and
women’s career development and growth.174 That is, marital status
and gender have different impacts on career for men versus women. Specifically, using signaling theory,175 these researchers argue
that the female gender and having children and/or dependents are
associated with negative attributes and stereotypes in senior decision makers’ minds, which ultimately influences their workplace decisions regarding women––especially women who are in committed
relationships or have dependents.176 Because organizational decision-makers have incomplete information about employees, they
rely on such signals to determine an employee’s competence, fit,
and commitment to the organization.177 Indeed, in the absence of
full information, as noted earlier, decision makers are likely to rely
on familiarity, similarity, and social indicators of employee ability
and motivation, regardless of whether such signals and indicators
are defensible or job-related and necessary. Superiors also use gender and family status to predict how productive or worthy of developmental investment a subordinate is—that is, to predict their
potential social exchange.178 To that end, being married and having
children is more likely to harm women’s careers or their developmental opportunities, in comparison to single women or their male
counterparts with or without dependents.

In this context, we posit that sharing a cultural background
with top managers in the organization will likely reduce the negative discriminatory effects of family status, especially for women.
Shared social and cultural identities facilitate interpersonal interactions.179 According to social identity theory, individuals categorize
themselves and others into different categories (demographic, social, cultural, for example) onto which they attach values, and maintain their self-esteem by highly valuing the categories they identify
with personally.180 The similarity-attraction theory suggests that
individuals who are similar or are perceived to belong to similar
demographic, social, and cultural categories will be interpersonally
attracted, leading to mutual liking and positive perceptions of each
other.181 Having similar values, beliefs, and assumptions, historical
experiences and “cultural capital” promotes communication, trust
and reciprocity.182 Following this logic, we expect that sharing a
cultural background with superiors in an organization will be particularly useful for women who are married or have dependents,
as such similarity may neutralize the negativity usually associated
with these family status signals.
Our hypotheses are as follows:
Hypothesis 1: Gender, marital status, and sharing a cultural
background with top people in the organization will interact on183
career satisfaction. For married women, the relationship between
sharing a cultural background and career satisfaction will be stronger than it will be for their single counterparts. A shared cultural
background should equally benefit married and single men.
Hypothesis 2: Gender, dependent status, and sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization will influence
employees’ career satisfaction. For women with dependents, the

“Interaction” is a term commonly used in the context of regression analyses to describe a statistical relationship involving multiple independent variables (antecedents) that simultaneously (but not additively) influence a dependent variable (outcome). Here, gender, marital status, and sharing a cultural
background with top people in the organization together influence career satisfaction. This combined influence is called an “interaction.”

relationship between a shared cultural background and career satisfaction will be stronger than for women without dependents. A
shared cultural background should equally benefit men regardless
of dependent status.
Hypothesis 3: Gender, marital status, and sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization will interact on
organizational position. For married women, the relationship between sharing cultural background and organizational position will
be stronger than it will be for their single counterparts. Sharing
cultural background should equally benefit married and single men.
Hypothesis 4: Gender, dependent status, and sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization will interact
on organizational position. For women with dependents, the relationship between a shared cultural background and organizational
position will be stronger than it will be for women without dependents. Sharing a cultural background should equally benefit men
regardless of dependent status.
Hypothesis 5: Gender, marital status, and sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization will interact on
benefitting from a network. For married women, the relationship
between a shared cultural background and benefitting from a network will be stronger than it will be for their single counterparts.
Sharing a cultural background should equally benefit married and
single men.
Hypothesis 6: Gender, dependent status and sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization will interact
on benefitting from a network. For women with dependents, the
relationship between sharing a cultural background and benefitting
from a network will be stronger than for women without dependents. Sharing a cultural background should equally benefit men
regardless of dependent status.
Hypothesis 7: Gender, dependent status, and a shared cultural background with top people in the organization will interact
on having a mentor. For women with dependents, the relationship
between sharing a cultural background and having a mentor will
be stronger than it will be for their single counterparts. Sharing a
cultural background should equally benefit married and single men.
Hypothesis 8: Gender, marital status and sharing a cultural
background with top people in the organization will interact on having a mentor. For married women, the relationship between sharing
a cultural background and having a mentor will be stronger than it
will be for women without dependents. Sharing a cultural background should equally benefit men regardless of dependent status.

Method
Data used in this study are part of a larger project on career
pathways for women to obtain organizational leadership.184 The
survey was administered to graduates of leading business schools
beginning in August 2007 and continuing into 2008. Surveys were
sent to 11,291 male and 3,198 female Master of Business Administration (MBA) graduates, 173 female and 274 male Master of Accounting graduates, and 1,393 female and 2,875 male Bachelor of
Business Administration (BBA) graduates of the Ross School of
Business at the University of Michigan, and 1,643 MBA, Master of
Accounting, and BBA graduates of the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida. Those with accounting and BBA
degrees were sent surveys if three or ten years had elapsed, respectively, since their graduation, allowing them sufficient time to climb
the ladder at their organizations. Through the above methods, we
received 887 usable surveys. Sixty-nine percent of the sample was
male, 69 percent indicated they were in a committed relationship,
and 71 percent reported having dependents. Descriptive statistics
of the analysis sample are included in Table 1.
D.

Measures
The independent, dependent, and control variables analyzed
in our study are described below.
1.

Independent Variables
The independent variables identified for this study are:
Gender. Males were coded as 1 and females as 0.
Committed relationship. Those who were married, in a civil
union, or in a long-term committed relationship were coded as 1;
and others (never married, divorced, widowed) were coded as 0.
Dependents. Respondents who indicated they had dependents were coded as 1 and others as 0.
Sharing a cultural background with top people in organization. Respondents answered the statement, “Over the course of
my career, I have shared a great deal of cultural background with
the people at the top levels of my organizations” on a scale of 1 to 5
where 1 = strongly disagree, and 5 = strongly agree.
2.

Dependent Variables

Career satisfaction. Respondents rated the item, “I am satisfied with the level I have reached in my career” on a five-point scale
ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.
Organizational position. Respondents indicated their reporting level to the top person in their organization on the following
scale: 1) Three or four levels below, 2) Two levels below, 3) Direct
report or one level below, and 4) I am the top person.
Mentor Yes No. Respondents indicated whether or not they
had mentors. Those with mentors were coded as 1 and those without mentors were coded as 0.
Benefit from network. Respondents rated a single statement,
“I have benefited from being part of a network,” on a five-point
scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.
3.

Control Variables
Following prior research,185 we controlled for five demographic, human-capital, organizational, and industry-related variables
that could influence the outcomes of interest. These are:
Age. Respondents reported their age based on the following
scale: 1) 20-29 years, 2) 30-39 years, 3) 40-49 years, 4) 50-59 years, 5)
60-69 years, and 6) 70+ years old.
Education level. Respondents indicated their educational
attainment on the following scale: 1) Associates Degree (2-year
college degree), 2) Bachelors Degree (4-year college degree), 3)
Master’s Degree, 4) Doctoral Degree, and 5) Professional Degree.
Firm size. Respondents indicated their firm size on the following scale: 1) Fewer than 50, 2) 50-499, 3) 500-999, 4) 1,000-9,999,
and 5) 10,000+.
Respondent industry. We controlled for industry using a dummy coding sequence where those with positions in service industries and manufacturing industries were contrasted with those in
other industries.

Analysis and Results
Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations,
and correlations are reported in Table 1. Among the independent
variables, all correlations were below .30, except that between

manufacturing and service industry (r = -.43), theoretically posing
no cause for concern. Variation inflation factor values indicated
no problems with multicollinearity. Hypotheses were tested using ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression and logistic
regression, where the control and independent variables were entered first, followed by the two-way interaction terms, and finally
the three-way interaction term in separate steps.
The three-way interaction of gender x committed relationship
x share cultural background was only significant for career satisfaction (β = .75, p < .05) and organizational position (β = .58, p < .05).
The three-way interaction of gender x dependents x share cultural
background was only significant for mentor yes no (β = -1.03, p <
.01) and benefit from network (β = -.86, p < .01).
To better understand the interactions, we plotted graphs of
the significant three-way interactions for each dependent variable
using unstandardized regression coefficients.

This graph suggests that single women with high cultural similarity with top people in the organization report higher career satisfaction than do married and committed women, who also have high
cultural similarity with top people. This is contrary to hypothesis
1. So, even if women have high cultural background similarity with
organizational leaders, the benefits are still higher for single than
for married women.

Figure 2 suggests that men and women––single or married––
who have low cultural background similarity to top people in the
organization do not differ much in the organizational position they
hold. Note that the lines all converge on the left side of the graph.
Indeed, there is no difference between women who are single and
those in committed relationships or between men who are single
and those in committed relationships. However, having cultural
similarity with top people in the organization appears to benefit
single women more than it does married women. This is contrary to
hypothesis 3. This suggests that with respect to sharing cultural similarity with top people, being married is a disadvantage for women,
but seems to be an advantage for men.

The graph depicted in Figure 3 suggests that for women with
dependents, having high cultural background similarity with top
people in the organization influences their likelihood of having a
mentor. This supports hypothesis 6. For men with dependents, sharing cultural similarity with top people does not seem to affect their
likelihood of having a mentor. So women with dependents fare
better if they share cultural background with top people in terms of
obtaining developmental resources such as mentoring. On the other hand, for men with dependents, sharing a cultural background
with organizational leadership provides neither an advantage nor
a disadvantage with respect to their likelihood of having a mentor.

Figure 4 plots the relationship between network benefits and
cultural background similarity with the top people in the organization, comparing male and female experiences. These data suggest
that neither gender nor dependent status makes a difference with
regard to network benefits for those with a low cultural background
similarity with top people. However, women with dependents gain
from having cultural similarity with top people. Women with dependents who also have high cultural background similarity with
top people report benefiting most from networks compared to other groups. This supports hypothesis 8. Yet, as shown in Figure 4,
the data suggest that for men with dependents, cultural background
similarity with top people does not seem to impact the benefits they
report receiving from networks. So, again, sharing cultural similarity with top people in the organization improves networking outcomes for women with dependents.

Finally, hypotheses 2, 4, 5 and 7 were not supported, as their
respective three-way interactions were not significant.

Discussion
The role of family status in men’s and women’s career development and progress continues to receive research attention.186
This study examines the relationships between family status (marital and dependent), sharing a cultural background with top people
in the organization and career, mentoring, and networking outcomes. Importantly, this study extends the Ramaswami, Huang, and
­Dreher187 cross-cultural study on gender x marital status interaction
on mentoring attainment by also examining the gender x dependent
status interaction on mentoring attainment (and other dependent
variables) as well as observing whether these interactions differ for
four career, mentoring, and networking outcomes, as a function of
the respondents’ similarity of cultural background with top people
in their organizations. Ramaswami and her colleagues found that,
in contrast to women in Taiwan, married women in the U.S. have a
lower likelihood of attaining mentors compared to single women.
However, for men, being married was still advantageous in having
mentors. Following their study, we tested whether sharing a cultural background with top people in the organization would help
women who are married or who have dependents to report higher
outcomes (career success, mentoring, and network benefits) than
their single counterparts.
Only some of our hypotheses were supported. Indeed, the
gender x marital status x sharing cultural background interaction
was significant only for career success variables such as career
satisfaction and organizational position, but we found that single
women benefited more than committed women for both outcomes.
Indeed, our results suggest that sharing cultural capital with top
people in the organization ––and the associated understanding that
arises from such similarity–– may not be enough to trump the negative associations of marital status on women’s career satisfaction
and organizational position. As hypothesized, the gender x dependent yes/no x sharing cultural background interaction was significant, but only for mentor yes/no and benefits from network and not
for the career success variables. In terms of other significant main
and interaction effects, marital status had no significant main effects
on the dependent variables. Gender and dependent status were
positively related to organizational position, and gender also to

mentor yes/no. Sharing cultural background was positively related
to all dependent variables. The only significant two-way interaction
was that of gender x sharing cultural background on organizational
position. This suggests that men who shared cultural background
with top people were more likely to be in higher organizational positions than women. The results of our study suggest that family
status continues to pose barriers for women’s careers in the U.S.
In line with Professor Ramaswami and her coauthors’ findings,188
these results once again show that, in the U.S. or Western context,
women who have high career attainment also tend to be single and/
or without children. 189
As is true with most studies, this study is not without limitations. Our analysis combined both formal and informal mentoring,
but only a small percentage of our respondents had formal mentors.
This study also does not distinguish between current and past mentoring, nor have we differentiated among various types of professional networks or types of dependents (children versus parents).
We used self-report cross-sectional data preventing us from making
conclusions regarding causality. In addition, we did not have data
from respondents’ significant others in their respective organizations (supervisors, superiors, teammates, etc.) regarding their perceptions of men and women who are in committed relationships,
have dependents, or share cultural backgrounds with top people in
the organizations.
Certainly, the influence of family status on men’s and women’s
careers is complex and warrants continued study. Our study underscores that diversity variables in isolation may not be able to paint
the complete picture. Considering the intersection of multiple diversity as well as organizational or contextual variables may shed
light on how gender and family status influence career, mentoring,
and networking outcomes for men and women.
III. Proposed Solutions
No matter the cause, it is clear that women are still effectively shut out of most leadership positions. In this Part, we propose
a combination of new judicial interpretations, regulatory disclosure requirements, and firm-level actions in an attempt to rectify
the problem. First, we propose that Title VII ––which, in its current form, has not been effective at breaking the glass ceiling–– be

reinterpreted to address the issue of leadership. As a result of the
Supreme Court’s affirmative action rulings, we are unable to adopt
the European approach of using quotas.190 However, we propose
that when deciding cases of employment discrimination for top
leadership positions, the courts impose a rebuttable presumption
of discrimination with respect to opportunities for advancement
when there are no women or only token women in top leadership
positions or on the board of directors. Second, as we advocated in
our previous work, we propose that the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) require that organizations report the numbers
of women occupying leadership and board positions.191 Finally,
based on our studies and the literature,192 we advocate for firms to

Proposed U.S. Approach
Title VII is an elastic statute, as the above discussion shows.
Disparate impact was adopted to eliminate “built-in head winds”193
and “unnecessary barriers”194 when progress was stalled. The decision to expand the reach of disparate impact by allowing evidence
of subjective decision-making was likewise designed to further the
goal of countering built-in headwinds. Also important was the
shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant after a relatively
easily met burden of proof on plaintiff’s part.195 The Weber decision was based on the spirit of Title VII to level the playing field
and open opportunities to protected groups.196 Coverage of sexual
harassment was read into the statute when that was recognized as a
problem.197 Fifty years after 1964 there is still a glaring, inexcusable
lack of women and minorities in leadership positions, and it is time
to expand Title VII once again.

Title VII can be stretched to facilitate this goal by establishing a rebuttable presumption that discrimination is at play if there
are no women, or only token women, in top leadership or board
positions at a company. It is difficult to make a statistical case when
leadership positions are involved in any one instance, as the number of top leadership positions in a company opening up at a particular time is not large enough to be statistically relevant.198 However, if board and top leadership positions were examined as a whole,
assuming 15-25 positions that fit within this category, the number
would be large enough to matter. A few token or no women in
these positions would then shift the burden of proof to the defendant to prove that it did not discriminate. This is admittedly a step
beyond the disparate impact scheme of burden shifting that occurs
once a relevant disparity is shown. However, since subjective selection methods are encompassed by the theory, and top positions are
filled by subjective selection, it would be consistent with precedent
in this regard.
Although small numbers of opportunities can be problematic, they are not insurmountable. In Watson, where the Court recognized that subjective or discretionary selection procedures that
lead to disparate impact could be actionable, Watson was denied
a promotion on four occasions.199 She was still able to show that
the unfettered discretion of the selectors resulted in discrimination.
Choosing board members and leaders is generally not a transparent
process to which those not selected would have access. Shifting the
burden greatly increases the possibility of a successful challenge; at
a minimum, it should facilitate getting to a jury.
A rebuttable presumption is not a quota, and it would not be
as effective as quotas have been elsewhere in the world.200 Yet, it
may be enough to finally put a crack in the glass ceiling and help
women achieve top management positions in sufficient numbers
to be meaningful. In Watson, the plurality was concerned that the
adoption of the disparate impact theory might cause employers to
adopt quotas because of the difficulty of validating subjective criteIn order to prove disparate impact, one must have a sample size that is
statistically significant. “Small sample sizes are often rejected as having little
probative value, because results from small sample sizes that show . . . disparity
can also be credited to or explained by simple random chance.” Melinda K.

ria used to select a candidate. This view, though, did not prevent
the adoption of the theory then. Consequently, it should not now
bar a device that could help overcome the barriers that lead to the
“markedly disproportionate”202 number of women being kept out
of these top leadership positions. A recent study shows that women
and minorities are punished when they appoint a woman or minority to a leadership position. 203 Thus, having a token woman or minority leader in place would not be effective in solving the problem.
A critical mass of women and minorities in leadership positions is
needed for the overall trajectory to improve.
Shifting the burden to the organization to show business necessity for its subjective (and usually nontransparent) selection process is consistent with a long line of cases that speak to Title VII’s
“broad remedial purposes” as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1991.204
It would be difficult to argue business necessity in light of the fact
that, when organizations include women on boards and in top management positions, the organizations do better financially and employees tend to be more satisfied, as they feel they have more of a
voice within the organization.205
Ideally, Congress would implement the presumption in the
statute. However, in the current political climate, this is highly unlikely. This does not prevent the EEOC from adopting a Guideline

The researchers performed an experiment in which they asked 395 students to watch trained actors playing human resources professionals pitching to

to this effect, which would be highly persuasive to courts. The EEOC
has often taken the lead on discrimination issues, and it should do
so here. The courts usually look to the EEOC when interpreting
Title VII. We advocate that both the EEOC and the courts adopt
this rule. Alternatively, if they are not willing to do this, the EEOC
and the courts should at a minimum follow the long line of cases
establishing burden shifting in favor of the protected group.
Such an approach is somewhat similar to the rules being adopted in the European Union (E.U.) countries domestically and
on the regional level overall, which aim to require or incentivize
higher woman board representation. While many countries have
adopted quotas as a fast-track to greater parity, quotas were a step
too far for the E.U. (and, of course, the U.S.). Adopting such an
approach would put the U.S. more in line with most developed
countries demonstrating that including women in leadership is important and just.
2.

The European Approach
European countries have attacked the problem of low female
representation in executive leadership by establishing quotas for
women, primarily in terms of board membership.206 The United
States bars a quota system based on the language of Bakke, the
case that allowed affirmative action in the public sector in 1978.207
As noted, the Supreme Court has recently imposed new limits on
the availability of affirmative action in some instances, and Bakke’s
quota ban is still good law. This does not mean, however, that we
cannot learn from the experience of the E.U.
Norway was the first to adopt a board member quota in 2008,
and its female representation now approaches 40 percent.208 Other European countries followed suit, and today Belgium, France,
Germany, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden have
“pink quotas.”209 Germany passed a law in March 2015 requiring
public companies to give 30 percent of board seats to women.210

The United Kingdom encourages female representation through its
corporate governance code,211 and Finland requires companies with
no women on their boards to tell investors why that is so.212 The
push, however, is not uniform throughout the European Union. Female board representation in Portugal, for example, was only 7.9
percent in 2014.213 By comparison, the 2014 Catalyst Census found
that women represent 19.2 percent of board seats at the top 500 U.S.

Recent research by Annick Masselot and Anthony Maymont analyzes the effectiveness of the French approach and compares it to
that of the E.U.217 The authors suggest that the French approach
has a wider reach because it applies to both executive and nonexecutive directors.218 As of November 2014, Germany requires
the boards of directors of its largest corporations to include 30
percent women nonexecutive directors by 2016.219 Firms that do

The push for women in board positions, particularly in the
Nordic countries, is contributing to leadership in other areas such as
politics.232 In Sweden, women now outnumber men in government
and it is considered the most gender-egalitarian country.233 Even
there, though, women make up only 25 percent of corporate boards,
earn 14 percent less than men, and still take 75 percent of all parental leave.234 Worried that progress had stalled, women established
the Feminist Initiative,235 a party that became the first to win a seat
in the European Parliament on a feminist platform.236 In September 2014, it also won a seat in the Swedish parliament.237
In the E.U., some see an increase in female board representation as a competitive advantage.238 In an effort to meet their quotas,
some international companies such as Sodexco SA, Fiat, and Logica PLC have actively recruited U.S. women, viewing it as an opportunity to gain U.S. business.239 Despite being the most desirable
candidates, only 12 percent of outside directors on the 500 largest
companies’ boards are female CFOs. 240

Regulatory Reporting Approach
A second approach, previously advocated by the authors, is
for the SEC to amplify the disclosure requirement regarding diversity. Companies are already required to disclose whether and,
if so, how diversity was considered when selecting candidates for

the board of directors. We propose that companies be required
to further disclose whether gender is included in any diversity considerations. A disclosure requirement would put the issue at the
forefront of consideration and may encourage companies to put
diversity policies encompassing gender in place, as failure to do so
could possibly have legal consequences.

Role of Mentors and Networks
Our findings should be particularly useful to organizations
and human resource managers interested in retaining female talent.
Mentoring has been described as an “intense reciprocal interpersonal exchange between a senior experienced individual (the mentor) and a less experienced individual (the protégé), characterized
by the type of guidance, counsel, and support provided by the mentor for the protégé’s career and personal development.”242 Having a mentor has implications for employees’ career advancement,
and the positive association of mentoring with career outcomes for
protégés makes it “a key employee development and talent management practice. . . .”243 Through mentoring, protégés are able to
more effectively enhance their skills and more easily adapt to new
work and/or non-work settings.244
Another helpful tool for better protégé development is networking. Networking is an alternative, complementary mechanism
to mentoring that provides career and moral support, advice, and
personal and interpersonal resources that aid in employees’ career
progression.245 It is the “process of gaining advice and moral supCorporate Governance, 17 C.F.R. § 229.407(c)(2)(vi) (2012).

helpful for those who did not have access to mentors early in their
careers.247 Networking and mentoring provide similar and complementary career benefits.248
As discussed earlier and despite evidence to the contrary,
women (regardless of marital or parental status) continue to suffer prejudices relating to their competence and commitment to the
career or job.249 However, women, and men and women who are
in committed relationships or have dependents, represent important sources of diversity at work.250 Networking and mentoring are

necessitates an examination of the role that mentoring plays in a
career-enhancing strategy such as networking.
In a prior study, we concluded that employers should provide
mentoring for women to help open networking pathways for them
to succeed in business.253 Relatedly, a 2011 study of college-educated men and women cited inadequate career development as the
primary reason women have not reached the top rungs of the corporate ladder.254 Women managers interviewed in one study suggested “that men, as the dominant group, may want to maintain their
dominance by excluding women from the informal interactions of
mentoring and networking.”255 Some studies suggest that the impact of mentorship and networking may be greatest for women in
male-dominated professions and industries.256 Women within these
industries are often in particular need of the sponsorship and legitimacy that mentorship and networking provide.257 Furthermore,
after an international assignment, and suggesting that home-based mentors and
access to networks while abroad are important factors in contributing to the
successful repatriation of international managers.); Ramaswami et al., Gender,
Mentoring, and Career Success, supra note 185, at 399 (“[T]he return to a mentoring relationship . . . appears greatest for women employed in male-gendered
industries. . . . [W]ithin industries characterized by general levels of female
underrepresentation or by aggressive, engineering-intensive, competitive, ‘upor-out’ corporate cultures, the importance of a senior-male mentor seems high
for female managers and professionals.”); Ramaswami et al., Interactive Effects,

higher compensation, career progress satisfaction, and organizational position

mentors may protect an individual from overt and covert forms of
discrimination, even discrimination they may not consciously realize exists.258
Utilizing the survey data described above, we found that
mentoring results in higher returns for women with dependents, in
terms of benefiting from a network. We further found that organizational and social support is particularly needed for women with
dependents to overcome challenges to networking. We thus advocate that firms invest more in the area of diversity training and cultivate greater sensitivity to the unique problems faced by women
with dependents with mentoring programs.
Conclusion
As documented above, although Title VII and the accompanying legislation and judicial rulings have made significant headway in improving the work environment for women, pathways for
women to positions of leadership in organizations are still generally
elusive. Our studies suggest that there are additional challenges for
women with dependents.
As a society, we should want to maximize the contributions of
all citizens, both at the leadership level and at every level below it.
Likewise, if we are to continue to replenish society, we should want
to encourage citizens to have children. As the above study shows,
women who have children are doubly disadvantaged in terms of
getting to the upper path to leadership. Since leadership opportunity is effectively denied to a large number of our female citizens, it
is time to again expand the reach of Title VII and help remedy this
type of discrimination.
In this paper, we offer three proposals to begin to achieve
more cultural diversity. First, recognizing that, unlike in the Nordic countries, quotas would not survive scrutiny in the U.S. judicial
system, we advocate that in cases alleging gender discrimination,
courts apply a rebuttable presumption that discrimination has occurred when a stark lack of women in leadership positions exists.
This analysis is a logical extension to the disparate impact analysis
firmly established in judicial precedents. Second, we see a role for
regulatory authorities: in its already mandated diversity reporting
requirements, the SEC could define diversity to encompass gender.

Finally, given the significance of cultural similarity, we advocate that
firms take mentoring seriously, and look beyond only those who
share cultural similarity and provide mentoring and networking opportunities to others as well.
We recognize that the problems are complex and elude simple solutions. We hope that our study and recommendations may
prompt further research and discussion to help break the logjam in
the pathway for women who seek high-level leadership positions.
