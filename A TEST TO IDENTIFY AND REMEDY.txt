A TEST TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDY
ANTI-GAY BIAS IN CHILD CUSTODY
DECISIONS AFTER OBERGEFELL

Introduction
For the last three decades, about half of all marriages have
ended in divorce, and many of these couples had children.1 The
law concerning parental rights and access to children after divorce
has shifted and changed through state law and modern trends. The
chief consideration for court decisions involving contested custody and parental responsibility today is what arrangement is in the
best interest of the child, or children, involved. When the Supreme
Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges2 in 2015, expanding the rights
of same-sex couples by recognizing their fundamental right to
marry,3 the case also expanded the parental rights of gay and lesbian parents nationally.4 Gay couples use assisted reproduction
and adoption to have children; in addition, many children with gay

parents were born to these parents in earlier heterosexual marriages or relationships.5 After Obergefell, courts will inevitably be faced
with increased litigation concerning physical custody and parental
decision-making in contested child custody cases involving lesbian,
gay, and bisexual (LGB) parents.6 As courts grapple with case-bycase determinations of the best interest of the children involved in
these cases, gay parents will need to remain vigilant to ensure that
judicial anti-gay prejudice does not affect those decisions.
In this Article, we propose a new test for gay parents who
believe that a court has improperly allowed anti-gay animus to
affect its custody/parenting time determination. Part I of this
Article describes the judicial standards that have evolved over
the last century governing decisions involving child custody in
divorce litigation, with particular emphasis on the modern best
interest of the child standard. Part II describes emerging constitutional protections for gay people, including the right to marry
recognized in Obergefell, and a recognition of the important role
that gay parents have in the lives of their children. Properly read,
Obergefell protects LGB parents from having their custody rights
to their children restricted on account of their sexual orientation.
Part III describes pockets of political and judicial resistance to
Obergefell in the United States legal system, and suggests that
attorneys remain alert to both overt and oblique expressions of
judicial prejudice against gays. It also proposes an appellate test
for use when LGB parents appeal a trial court decision alleging
that their parental rights have been improperly restricted by judges who harbor antigay animus. While the new test would help gay
parents who seek to assert their rights in family court, it ultimately
protects those with the least amount of power in disputed custody
cases: the children involved.
I. The Evolution of Custody Standards to Focus on the
Child’s Best Interest
Judges have long used evolving cultural norms and judicial
standards in making decisions about child custody in divorce litigation. Those norms once allowed judges to empower one parent

We limit our analysis in this Article to sexual orientation, as the Supreme
Court has not yet directly addressed gender identity in the due process or equal
protection context. However, the principles of equality advanced in this Article
would presumably apply in the transgender context as well.

over the other based solely on gender. From common law through
the eighteenth century, women had few rights, and fathers had ultimate authority over their children.7 Courts in the nineteenth century took the opposite view, and presumed maternal supremacy for
child rearing.8 This resulted in the “tender years doctrine,” a nearly
automatic granting of child custody to mothers in separation and
divorce cases, especially for young children.9 This doctrine lasted
well into the twentieth century.10 Support for gender equality, which
increased rapidly throughout the 1960s and 70s, helped shift and
redefine parental roles. Automatic placement of children with their
mothers after divorce declined as parenting responsibility grew
more balanced,11 fathers’ rights groups argued for more equal parenting,12 and researchers described the psychic wounds caused by

that the child’s best interests required maternal custody, reasoning that only
mothers could provide the physical care needed by young children. The ‘tender
years’ presumption was virtually conclusive. To rebut it, the father had to prove
the mother ‘unfit’—that her care would severely harm the child. Throughout the
past decade, however, courts and legislatures began to realize that many fathers
are able to nurture young children. These decisionmakers recognized that the
tender years presumption, devised to promote the child’s welfare, undermined
the best interests principle. Today, no jurisdiction retains the presumption as a
matter of statutory law, and most jurisdictions have abolished the presumption
as a matter of common law as well. A few jurisdictions retain the presumption
but have demoted it to ‘tie-breaker’ status, to be invoked only in the rare case
when other factors are equal. The fate of the tender years presumption illustrates that courts and legislatures have recognized that presumptions in legal
issues involving children prevent courts from carefully looking into the circumstances of the individual child.”).

children being cut off from a parent after divorce. The custody
decisions concerning children of divorced parents shifted to a caseby-case determination of what living arrangements met the needs
and interests of the children involved,14 known today as a best interest standard.15
The federal Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act16 approving
the best interest standard, was first implemented in California and
subsequently adopted by most states.17 The legal terminology used
to describe post-divorce parenting has also shifted to encourage a
more cooperative approach, with the term “parenting time” used
by many states to promote a shared parenting approach.18 In an

The “best interests of the child” standard requires consideration of “all
relevant factors, including the child’s health, safety, and welfare, any history of
abuse by one parent against any child or the other parent, and the nature and

attempt to limit the conflict over the children, divorcing parents
are often required to attend mediation to resolve their differences amicably.19 In addition, many states require parents to develop
a parenting time schedule together to ensure that their child has
access to them both,20 and some states require divorcing parents to
take parenting classes to reduce the animosity between them and
put the child’s wellbeing first.21 All of these efforts are intended to

parties to submit a parenting plan in all or some types of custody cases.”). For
example, Florida law “now require[s] the court to create or approve a ‘parenting plan’ which establishes how divorced parents will share the responsibilities
of childrearing and decision-making with regard to the child and sets forth a
time-sharing schedule.” In re Amendments to the Fla. Family Law Rules, 995
So. 2d 445 (Fla. 2008). Colorado law provides:
In order to implement an order allocating parental responsibilities,
both parties may submit a parenting plan or plans for the court’s approval that shall address both parenting time and the allocation of
decision-making responsibilities. If no parenting plan is submitted or
if the court does not approve a submitted parenting plan, the court,
on its own motion, shall formulate a parenting plan that shall address
parenting time and the allocation of decision-making responsibilities.
When issues relating to parenting time are contested, and in other cases
where appropriate, the parenting plan must be as specific as possible to
clearly address the needs of the family as well as the current and future
needs of the aging child.

ensure that parents themselves—instead of the court—make decisions about their children.22 Thus, when former spouses agree on
parenting arrangements, the court will typically approve any agreement they develop “without considering the details” of how parents
live their lives.23
As many legal researchers have noted, parents frequently settle issues of custody and parenting time without resorting to litigation.24 Indeed, controversies over parenting time typically originate
with a litigant parent who attempts to restrict the other parent’s

agree that the court must resolve issues of parenting using the best
interest of the child standard.26 State laws enumerate certain factors
that judges should consider in determining what would be in the
child’s best interest with regard to custody. Many states include factors such as the parents’ love and affection for the child;27 the child’s
emotional attachment;28 the parents’ ability to provide essential
support including food, shelter, clothing, and medical care; evidence
of domestic violence and child abuse; the willingness of one parent

finds that a parent has not complied with the parenting time order or schedule
and has violated the court order, the court, in the best interests of the child
[ . . . ].”
27
Parents’ “love and affection” for their child can be determined in a variety of ways. See, e.g., Custody and Parenting Time Investigation Manual, Mich.
State Ct. Admin. Office, Tab B, Factor a, 1-2 (2002), http://courts.mi.gov/Administration/SCAO/Resources/Documents/Publications/Manuals/focb/cp_investigationmnl.pdf (stating that the love, affection, and other emotional ties
between the child and parties involved is a factor that an investigator must
evaluate when suggesting custody arrangements). This factor examines the
mutual parent-child relationship through determining which of the parents
has bonded more closely with the child. Id. This bond is observed through
the investigator placing emphasis on several considerations including but not
limited to: which parent the child goes to when in need of support or when
sharing information, which parent has regularly provided day to day care for
the child, in what ways does each parent place significance on their relationship with the child (which parent invests or places priority over other things
to spend time with the child), and the presence of any evidence suggesting
one parent shares problems with the child which demonstrates an inappropriate parent-child relationship. Id.
28
Courts that questioned the best interests of the child standard in the private custody context agued that he test was defined too narrowly, since judges
applying the test sometimes ignored the child’s emotional attachments to his
natural parents in favor of the child’s physical and financial needs. Development in the Law: The Constitution and the Family, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1196, 1223

to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent; the stability
of the home;29 and the mental and physical health of the parent.30
Included among these factors is the “moral fitness” of the
parent.31 Courts can consider parents’ sexual conduct in determining custody.32 Before Obergefell, some judges believed that a parent’s sexual orientation and living arrangements with a same-sex
partner were grounds to restrict a parent’s access to his/her child.33
Lesbian and gay parents have faced discrimination for attending
religious services that are affirming of lesbian and gay people or
for participating in lesbian and gay political organizations. In H.
v. P.,34 the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld an order forbidding
a gay father from bringing his children to gay political gatherings
or to a gay-affirming church.35 Similarly, in Marlow v. Marlow,36 the
29
“‘[B]est interest of the child’ means the sum total of the following factors
to be considered, evaluated, and determined by the court: . . . (c) The capacity
and disposition of the parties involved to provide the child with food, clothing,
medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws
of this state in place of medical care, and other material needs. (d) The length
of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment, and the desirability of maintaining continuity. (e) The permanence, as a family unit, of the
existing or proposed custodial home or homes. (f) The moral fitness of the parties involved. (g) The mental and physical health of the parties involved. (h) The
home, school, and community record of the child. (i) The reasonable preference
of the child, if the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express
preference. (j) The willingness and ability of each of the parties to facilitate and
encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child
and the other parent or the child and the parents. (k) Domestic violence, regardless of whether the violence was directed against or witnessed by the child

2016] Anti-Gay Bias In Child Custody Decisions 87
Indiana Court of Appeals sustained an order denying custody to
a gay father because of his involvement in gay and lesbian church
groups and with the organization Parents, Families and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays.37
The pre-Obergefell case law, in fact, is rife with cases involving
gay parents who lost their parental rights because of their sexual orientation,38 or on the grounds that they violated state sodomy
laws.39 Although the rights of gay people have improved significantly since the 1970s, there remains a notable anti-gay bias in some
courtrooms.40 To cite one obvious example, Obergefell itself was a
Id. at 736-38.
See, e.g., Weigand v. Houghton, 730 So. 2d 581, 586-88 (Miss. 1999) (denying a gay father’s request to modify denial of custody even though the child
lives with the mother’s new husband, who is a convicted felon and wife abuser);
S.E.G. v. R.A.G., 735 S.W.2d 164, 166-67 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987) (favoring the custody rights of alcoholic father over those of the lesbian mother); Pulliam v. Smith,
501 S.E.2d 898, 904 (N.C. 1998) (approving the trial court’s decision to modify
custody from the gay father to the mother, presuming that the conduct between
the father and his gay partner was “improper” and therefore “detrimental to
the best interest and welfare of the two minor children.”)
39
See, e.g., Thigpen v. Carpenter, 730 S.W.2d 510, 514 (Ark. Ct. App. 1987)
(Cracraft, J., concurring) (denying custody to a mother because sodomy is seen
as “immoral, unacceptable, and criminal conduct”); Roe v. Roe, 324 S.E.2d 691,
694 (Va. 1985). In Roe, the court relied on the sodomy statute to support its
conclusion that the gay father necessarily was the less fit parent even though
Virginia’s sodomy statute applied equally to both same-sex and different-sex
sexual conduct. See Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-361 (2011) (prohibiting “any person”
from engaging in oral or anal sex with “any male or female person”)
to private schools).r childrenty (noting that the same right protect parents’
back to that footnote here once we have them full (amended 2014). Although
sodomy laws were seldom used to prosecute gay people in the days before Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578-79 (2003) invalidated them, these statutes maintained symbolic significance, permitting courts to assert that gay parents were
considered improper and unequal under the law.
40
Because most courts do not classify sexual orientation as suspect, they do
not apply heightened scrutiny to claims arising from sexual orientation discrimination and instead review such claims under the lenient rational basis analysis.
Andrea L. Claus, The Sex Less Scrutinized: The Case for Suspect Classification
for Sexual Orientation, 5 Phoenix L. Rev. 151, 153 (2011). See, e.g., Lofton v.
Sec’y of the Dep’t of Children & Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 818 n.4 (11th Cir.
2004) (holding that gay people are not “members of a suspect class”). But see
SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories, 740 F.3d 471 (9th Cir. 2014)
(holding that gay people are members of a suspect class, and that laws which disfavor them must thus be subject to heightened scrutiny); cf. Obergefell, 135 S. Ct.
at 2594 (noting that homosexuality is “immutable” despite historical prejudice).
The language in Obergefell has led at least one legal commentator to propose
that the decision lays the groundwork to apply heightened scrutiny to all sexual
orientation-based classifications. See Ian Millhiser, Here Is The Single Most Important Word In Today’s Historic Marriage Equality Opinion, ThinkProgress

5-to-4 decision, with four Justices maintaining that laws blatantly
disfavoring gay people because of their sexuality comported with
the Fourteenth Amendment. Predictably, some conservative politicians, judges, and members of the public have cited Obergefell’s
narrow margin as reason to ignore its holding.41 A state supreme
court justice has openly resisted the sweeping expansion of rights
to gay people.42 Although discrimination against gay people has not
been outlawed nationally in other legal contexts,43 the sweeping
language of Obergefell provides new protections for gay people.

The authors’ review of all 50 states’ custody laws did not disclose any
statutes explicitly disfavoring gay parents in custody battles. In instances where
egregious discrimination in custody case has nevertheless occurred, appellate
courts have stepped in to prevent injustice—by, for instance, holding that a trial
judge may not take judicial notice that the homosexuality of a parent makes
that parent unfit. See, e.g., Maradie v. Maradie, 680 So.2d 538, 541-42 (Fla. 1st
DCA 1996). In Bezio v. Patenaude, 410 N.E.2d 1207, 1215-16 (Mass. 1980), the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts overruled the trial court’s holding
that the fact that the mother was a lesbian made her unfit to have custody. As

that gay parents have a negative impact on their children.45 Thus,
the gay community must remain vigilant about problematic judicial opinions grounded in prejudice against LGB parents. Although
judges are instructed to use the “neutral” best interest of the child
standard as a guide, “the judge, as a human being, will apply his or
her own standards and prejudices when deciding which parent gets
custody.”46 Such animus still exists. In Ex Parte H.H., for example,
the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed a trial court ruling denying
custody to a mother who was lesbian.47 Chief Justice Roy Moore’s
concurring opinion criticized homosexuality as an “inherent evil
and an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.”48
Subsequently, Chief Justice Moore was later removed from the
Alabama Supreme Court by the Alabama Court of the Judiciary
for refusal to follow judicial rulings.49 Alabama voters re-instated
him as chief justice of the state’s supreme court in 2012.50 In 2014,
Chief Justice Moore’s Supreme Court of Alabama defied a federal judge’s order to implement same-sex marriage in the state.51 In
2016, thirteen Alabama judges refused to issue marriage licenses
to any couple, apparently to avoid issuing marriage licenses to gay
the court noted in M.P. v. S.P., 404 A.2d 1256, 1263 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.
1979), removing children from lesbian or gay parents “diminishes their regard
for the rule of human behavior, everywhere accepted, that we do not forsake
those to whom we are indebted for love and nurture merely because they are
held in low esteem by others.” Appellate courts, however, have by no means
functioned as consistent protectors of gay parents’ rights. See, e.g., Bottoms v.
Bottoms, 457 S.E.2d 102, 108 (Va. 1995) ( “Conduct inherent in lesbianism is
punishable as a Class 6 felony in the Commonwealth . . . thus, that conduct is
another important consideration in determining custody.”).

couples. Even more recently, a Utah judge ordered a baby girl
removed from her foster parents—a lesbian couple—declaring that
the mothers’ sexual orientation would be detrimental to the child’s
wellbeing.53 Just months after this incident, a Utah legislator introduced a bill that would legalize such actions, permitting judges to
favor opposite-sex couples over same-sex couples in adoption and
foster placement.54 These cases make painfully clear the continuing
danger of anti-gay bias in child-related court decisions.55

II. Judicial Expansion of the Rights of Gay Partners
and Parents
The Supreme Court first affirmed the existence of constitutional protections for gay and bisexual Americans in the 1996
case Romer v. Evans.56 Romer involved a challenge to Colorado’s Amendment 2, a state constitutional amendment adopted by
popular vote. The provision barred municipalities from protecting gays and bisexuals against discrimination.57 The amendment’s
“sheer breadth,” the Court explained, was “so discontinuous with
the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable
by anything but animus toward the class it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.”58 Further, a law that

singled out sexual minorities for mistreatment raised “the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity
toward the class of persons affected.”59 The Court then quoted United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno,60 which stated the
principle that “if the constitutional conception of ‘equal protection
of the laws’ means anything, it must at the very least mean that a
bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate government interest.”61 Put simply, mere animus
toward gays cannot constitute a legitimate state interest under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Seven years after Romer, the Court significantly expanded the
scope of gays’ constitutional rights with its holding in Lawrence v.
Texas.62 In a landmark ruling, the Court invalidated Texas’s samesex sodomy ban, holding that anti-sodomy laws, gay and straight,
violated the “liberty” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment’s
Due Process Clause.63 The Court wrote that when “homosexual
conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in
and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.”64 A sodomy ban “demeans the lives of homosexual persons” and imposes
a “stigma,” raising serious constitutional questions.65 The Court also
ridiculed the notion that sexual acts could be unyoked from sexual
identity, or that sexual encounters defined same-sex relationships:
“When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with
another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal
bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.”66
Taken together, Romer and Lawrence made clear that neither
the state nor its agents may demean, disadvantage, or stigmatize
gay people simply because of their sexual orientation. It was no surprise, then, when the Court in 2013 invalidated the federal Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) in United States v. Windsor.67 Congress
passed DOMA in 1996, when it seemed likely that the Hawaii
Supreme Court would strike down its state’s same-sex marriage

ban. As Justice Kagan noted during Windsor oral arguments, the
House of Representatives report on DOMA stated that, by enacting the law, “Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality.”69
DOMA directly harmed thousands of gay couples who had
married in the handful of states that then allowed same-sex marriage, namely by depriving them of federal marriage benefits. In
Windsor, the Court struck down the law for violating “basic due
process and equal protection principles”70 by “demean[ing]”71
same-sex couples on account of their orientation. Two years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges,72 the Court extended this reasoning to
its logical conclusion, striking down state-level same-sex marriage
bans across the country. These laws, the Court wrote, deprive gay
people of their fundamental right to marry, irrationally imposing an
unjustifiable “stigma and injury” on them.73 In doing so, the Court
held, same-sex marriage bans violated the Due Process and Equal
Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.74
Romer, Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell have been criticized for their failure to specify a standard of review for laws that
disadvantage sexual minorities.75 At times, however, both Windsor
and Obergefell seem to imply that such laws must be subject to a
heightened standard of judicial scrutiny.76 Indeed, the Ninth Circuit

For instance, Windsor calls for “careful consideration” of DOMA—
not a term typically associated with permissive rational basis review—and
Obergefell twice describes sexual orientation as “immutable.” U.S. v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693 (2013); Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2594, 2596. Laws
that discriminate on the basis of an immutable trait often trigger heightened scrutiny. See, e.g., Ian Millhiser, Here Is The Single Most Important
Word In Today’s Historic Marriage Equality Opinion, ThinkProgress (June

2016] Anti-Gay Bias In Child Custody Decisions 93
Court of Appeals cited Windsor as proof that gays are a suspect
class meriting heightened scrutiny.77 According to the Ninth Circuit, Windsor “requires that when state action discriminates on the
basis of sexual orientation, we must examine its actual purposes
and carefully consider the resulting inequality to ensure that our
most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages
of stigma or second-class status. In short, Windsor requires heightened scrutiny.”78 Even if the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion was incorrect, the power of its analysis remains undeniable. Windsor—and,
to a greater extent, Obergefell—served as sweeping declarations of
the “equal dignity” of gay Americans,79 casting doubt on the validity
of any state action that demeans sexual minorities on account of
their orientation.80
Perhaps the most obvious state action called into question by
Windsor and Obergefell is the unequal treatment of parents based
on their sexual orientation. By their plain text, these two cases may
pertain only to same-sex marriages. Their holdings, however, also
state that gay people have a constitutional right to birth, adopt, and
raise children—and that the children of gay parents hold dignitary
rights as well. In Windsor, the Court wrote that the federal gay
marriage ban “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being
raised by same-sex couples”81 and “makes it even more difficult for
the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own
family and its concord with other families in their community and in
their daily lives.”82 This humiliation, Kennedy suggested, was a large
part of why the law “violates basic due process and equal protection
principles.”83 In Obergefell, the Court expanded on this reasoning:
Without the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, [same-sex couples’] children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow
lesser. They also suffer the significant material costs of
being raised by unmarried parents, relegated to a more

difficult and uncertain family life. The marriage laws
at issue here thus harm and humiliate the children of
same-sex couples.84
Accordingly, the Court concluded, the right to “bring up children” is, as a component of the right to marry, “a central part of
the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.”85 It follows that
this right may not be devalued because a parent is gay. Put differently, if the Constitution protects gay people’s right to raise children, it also forbids courts from diminishing these rights on account
of a parent’s sexual orientation. Windsor and Obergefell point so
clearly toward a constitutional right of gays to be free of discrimination in parenting decisions, in fact, that few states have fought
this logical next step. Ohio, for example, quickly changed its laws
after Obergefell to permit same-sex couples to adopt jointly.86 Utah
briefly battled gay joint adoption, but quickly acceded following a
legal challenge.87 In fact, only one state, Mississippi, has argued that
Obergefell has no bearing on gay couples’ right to adopt and raise
children.88 This argument did not fare well in court: A federal judge
recently invalidated the state’s anti-gay adoption ban, the last of its
kind in the nation.89
While gay parents have won a sweeping formal victory, however, animus toward them is not manifested exclusively in the law
books. As previously mentioned, many married couples with children separate—sometimes, because one spouse realized he was gay

2016] Anti-Gay Bias In Child Custody Decisions 95
and therefore elected to end his heterosexual marriage.90 When ruling on child-sharing and custody matters, judges have vast discretion to favor one parent over another. Often, this discretion permits
judges to make carefully tailored decisions about parents’ individual strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes, however, it allows judges
to quietly inject anti-gay bias into their decisions. A parent must
have recourse to challenge an adverse custody decision that may
have been motivated by such bias.
III. A New Test to Identify Bias in Custody Decisions
Over the last several decades, the Supreme Court has articulated a variety of judicial tests designed to help individuals protect
their constitutional right to equal treatment before the law from
infringement by governmental actors. The Court has repeatedly
recognized that not every discriminatory government action will
explicitly announce its intent, nor will every act of unconstitutional
discrimination be immediately recognizable as such. Racism, sexism, and other forms of animus repugnant to the Due Process and
Equal Protection Clauses may be dressed in neutral garb in order
to pass constitutional muster.91
Thus, the Court has developed certain modes of inquiry, tailored to a limited set of circumstances, which may reveal the illegitimate animus underlying a state action. For example, defendants
may challenge a prosecutor’s use of a peremptory strike during jury
selection if he believes the strike was motivated by the prospective
juror’s race92 or sex.93 Likewise, if a public housing resident can show
that an ostensibly neutral zoning action was actually race-based, the
government must establish that it would have made the same decision had race not been considered.94 Similarly, the Supreme Court
90
This situation is probably the most typical circumstance in which a judge
might introduce anti-gay bias into a custody dispute. There are certainly others,
but we will use the example of a heterosexual marriage ended by one homosexual spouse as our chief example.
91
The court recognized the problem of camouflaged invidious discrimination in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976) and Personnel Administrator
of Massachusetts. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), although it did not use these
decisions as occasions to expand plaintiffs’ ability to combat such potential
discrimination.

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

[Vol. 23.79

has developed tests to help lower courts interpret and apply statutes barring discrimination. For example, in McDonnell Douglas
v. Green,95 the Court devised a burden-shifting test which allowed
employees to present a prima facie case of discrimination, then
permitted employers to put forth evidence justifying their adverse
employment action on neutral grounds.96
In order to uncover possible anti-gay bias in custody proceedings, courts should import principles from this line of cases, scrutinizing neutral justifications for potential pretext.97 This test will
most likely be used in situations where an opposite-sex couple with
children divorces because one spouse came out as gay. However, it
may be employed in other custody cases involving same-sex parents—for example, a case of disputed custody over a foster child.98
Not every gay parent who is disfavored in a custody dispute is
the victim of discrimination. To prevent a floodgates issue, only gay
parents who can present prima facie evidence of potential discrimination should be permitted to ask an appeals court to reverse the
judgment against them. Prima facie evidence should demonstrate
that the trial court was aware of the parent’s orientation, either
because he stated it or because it could easily be gleaned during
the proceedings.99 This evidence should also include plausible indications that the gay parent was disfavored in the custody proceeding for no justifiable reason, or disproportionately to the stated
reason. For example, a gay parent with an extremely demanding
work schedule and frequent business trips need not necessarily

resulted even had the impermissible purpose not been considered.”).

97
We encourage civil liberties groups to advocate for the reforms outlined
in this Article through impact litigation. However, we also believe that appeals
courts can adopt this test sua sponte. With Obergefell on the books, appellate
judges must develop methods by which to filter out anti-gay animus embedded
in lower court rulings. Our test provides a common-sense framework for this
process that judges may utilize when weighing, interpreting, and applying equal
protection and due process principles.

foster children. Gay Rights Advocates Vow to Fight Utah Bill on Adoptions, N.Y.

99
A gay parent’s orientation will likely be discussed at some point during
any custody proceeding—when, for instance, both parents discuss future romantic partners with whom they may cohabitate, or when the spouses explain
their reasons for separating.

2016] Anti-Gay Bias In Child Custody Decisions 97
be allotted equal child sharing time—but he should not be unduly
restricted from his child, either.100
If the gay parent has put forth sufficient evidence of seemingly unjustified discriminatory actions, then the appeals court should
then consider evidence of anti-gay bias on the part of the judge.
Because the introduction of evidence at the appeals level would be
impractical, the appeals court will typically have to rely on evidence
presented during the lower court proceedings. That means any
attorney representing a gay parent (or same-sex parents) should be
vigilant about uncovering and presenting this evidence as early as
possible—ideally, before the lower court proceedings have begun.
And if the evidence is strong, the attorney should quickly move to
disqualify the judge. Disqualification standards on both the federal
and state level typically encourage parties to bring a disqualification motion at the earliest moment after discovering the relevant
facts.101 These motions must demonstrate the serious possibility that
the judge was not impartial.102 Demonstration of actual bias, however, is not required; it suffices for disqualification that a judge’s
impartiality “might reasonably be questioned.”103
An early disqualification motion is a double-edged sword. It
could further antagonize a judge, or it could put her on notice that a
seemingly anti-gay ruling will almost surely be appealed. Nonetheless, most courts insist on early disqualification motions. The policy
is seen as a means of preserving limited judicial resources,104 and
of ensuring that plaintiffs do not wait to make a disqualification
motion until they face an adverse verdict.105
But in the interest of justice, plaintiffs must maintain a right

In some cases, a judge’s decision to allot minimal custody rights to a gay
parent may be facially reasonable. For instance, a gay parent who is frequently
incarcerated, or addicted to life-endangering drugs, may be given minimal parenting time without giving rise to the inference of anti-gay discrimination.

presumptively untimely, they are allowed in a narrow set of circumstances when the moving party can show good cause for its tardiness.106 For example, a party may succeed in a post-trial motion for
disqualification where the disqualifying facts did not come to light,
or were not appreciated as showing bias, until the conclusion of the
trial.107
Even when disqualifying facts are discovered following the
judgment, courts may ask why the moving party failed to uncover
such facts before or during the trial.108 When the evidence could
have been discovered early in the proceedings by simple lawyerly
due diligence, a court is less likely to consider it acceptable grounds
for retrial.109 For that reason, attorneys representing a gay parent
in custody proceedings should review the records and public statements of the judge to whom their case has been assigned. Attorneys
need not perform an exhaustive search—just enough to demonstrate on appeal that they searched for apparent animus and found
none. They cannot be expected to have absolute prescience.
How might attorneys find such animus? One obvious way to
uncover it is to determine that the judge has ruled against other
gay parent litigants in a restrictive and unfair manner.110 A judge’s
record of rulings in custody cases involving gay parents should thus
be examined for a pattern of bias. Evidence of animus may also be
displayed during the trial at hand, if the judge exhibits egregious
and obvious anti-gay bias.111
Attorneys can also demonstrate judicial bias by looking
beyond the courtroom. For example, lawyers should be aware of
presentations that judges make to civic, bar, press, community, and

As a general rule, evidence of bias must come from an extrajudicial
source. See, e.g., United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583 (1966); United States v. Holland, 655 F.2d 44, 47 (5th Cir. 1981); Phillips v. Joint Legislative

However, the Supreme Court has found that recusal motions may stem from
in-courtroom statements when those statements “reveal such a high degree of
favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554 (1994).

church groups; comments made in the course of these events may
reveal disparaging, prejudicial remarks about gay people. When
judges express overt anti-gay sentiments about individual litigants,
the task of proving prejudice is straightforward. But more oblique
comments—such as general support for gender stereotypes, advocacy for adherence to strict gender roles, or disgust over same-sex
intimacy—may also be construed as evidence of anti-gay animus.112
When attorneys do not discover evidence of anti-gay bias
before or during the initial proceedings, they must explain why
their disqualification motion is not untimely when presenting such
evidence to the appeals court. In weighing whether to approve the
post-trial motion, the appeals court must focus on two factors. First,
it should examine whether the attorney has shown “good cause” for
his late motion—that is to say, his failure to find evidence of bias at
an earlier date is excusable.113 Second, the court should ensure that
the late motion does not contain “the earmarks of an eleventh-hour
ploy based upon . . . dissatisfaction” with the judge’s decision.”114
Such a ploy will be rooted in flimsy facts, with no solid evidence of
judicial bias. Its lack of merit should be readily apparent.
If the appeals court decides that the tardiness is justified, it
should proceed to review the evidence to decide whether indicia
of bias are sufficient to warrant reversal. This review will involve
a balancing of interests. There is a serious interest in finality and
conservation of judicial resources that weighs heavily against reversal.115 At the same time, the constitutional interests of due process
and equal protection weigh in favor of close scrutiny and reversal in borderline cases. There is no single rule that will determine
the outcome of any given case. Instead, the reviewing court should
“draw on its judicial experience and common sense” to determine
when reversal is required.116 Where evidence of bias is weak, and
there is a non-prejudiced “obvious alternative explanation” for the
lower court’s decision, reversal will presumably be unnecessary.117
112
These comments need not conclusively prove that the judge is biased
against gays. Rather, they need only establish the appearance of bias. The serious possibility that a judge is biased against a defendant, including for reasons
of prejudice, may be enough to merit disqualification. See, e.g., In re Faulkner,
856 F.2d 716, 720 (5th Cir. 1988).
113
See, e.g., United States v. Townsend, 478 F.2d 1072, 1074 (3rd Cir. 1973)
(allowing a recusal motion filed after the statute of limitations had passed because the judge’s bias did not manifest itself publicly until five days before trial).

On the other hand, where evidence of bias is strong and alternative explanations seem pretextual, reversal may be constitutionally
compelled. If the appeals court finds sufficient evidence of anti-gay
bias on the part of the judge to decide that reversal is indeed necessary, then the court should vacate the lower court’s decision and
remand the case to a different judge.118 If the appeals court does not
find such evidence, the plaintiff must accept the lower court judge’s
decision as final.
Conclusion
Parents’ right to custody determinations free of anti-gay animus is protected by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Courts must not permit that right
to be diluted by allowing judges to inject such animus, unchecked,
into custody proceedings. By granting parents an avenue to contest
potential illegitimate animus, the test outlined in this Article would
serve as an important tool to protect rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The “equal dignity”119 afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment will be rendered meaningless if gay parents lack recourse to
vindicate those rights in court.

118
It is not uncommon for courts of appeals to remand cases with the instruction that a new judge preside over the trial—especially where bias is a
concern. See, e.g., Sentis Group, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 559 F.3d 888, 904 (8th Cir.
2009); United States v. Tucker, 78 F.3d 1313, 1323-24 (8th Cir. 1996).
