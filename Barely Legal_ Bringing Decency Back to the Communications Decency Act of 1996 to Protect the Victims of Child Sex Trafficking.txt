Introduction
The sex trafficking industry, once driven by clandestine
exchanges in dark alleys and along abandoned street curbs, has
migrated to a range of more convenient and profitable platforms.1
The introduction of classified sex advertisements to the internet
transformed the sex trafficking industry.2 Traffickers leverage the
convenience and speed of the internet and mobile devices to not
only recruit and market victims, but also to access a more diverse,
wealthy, and widespread clientele.3 At the same time, rather than
risk arrest, potential clients plan their surreptitious trysts using cellphones and laptops from the perceived safety and convenience of
their offices, cars, hotels, and homes—shielded by anonymity and

emboldened by distance.4 Arranging sex for money is now as easy
as scheduling in-store pickup at Starbucks or Target on your phone
or laptop, and Backpage provides the platform to do so.5
Backpage is an internet service provider that hosts web-based
advertisements for goods and services—including illegal advertisements for sex-trafficked minors.6 Backpage has systematically and
manually edited content to conceal illegal transactions that the site
facilitates.7 Yet Backpage leveraged immunity afforded by Section
230 of the Communications Decency Act to avoid liability.8
This Comment argues that the automatic and manual editing of
illicit web-based classified advertisements to remove signs of illegal
activity is not a traditional editorial practice that merits federally mandated immunity under Section 230.9 Part I discusses the progression
of web-based classified sex advertisements, the dichotomy between
print and web-based liability, and the First Circuit’s flawed decision in Doe v. Backpage to explain the legal backdrop against which

Section 230 has been interpreted and developed.10 Part II argues that
Backpage has unjustly utilized and benefited from the historically
liberal interpretation of Section 230 and its grant of immunity.11 Part
II further contends that the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of Section 230 offers sufficiently compelling persuasive authority to elicit
a different ruling in Doe v. Backpage.12 Part III recommends that
internet service providers that engage in editorial practices aimed
at circumventing law enforcement efforts should be deemed content providers, and thereby subject to civil liability for the illegality of
their edits.13 Part III concludes that permitting survivors of sex trafficking to pursue civil remedies better punishes culpable parties that
proliferate child sex trafficking via internet-based classified advertisements, ultimately offering a more holistic form of justice.14 Part
III further reviews recently proposed legislation and its potential to
punish culpable parties and achieve holistic justice.15

The Rise of the Internet Sex Industry and the Ensuing Success
of Backpage
Backpage has cornered the market for internet-based sex
advertisements.16 Before closing its “Adult Section” in January 2017,
the site was the largest classified sex advertising website service in
the world, hosting upwards of one million advertisements a day.17

approximately $16,500,000 per year from its classified sex advertisements in California alone.18
Following immense public pressure, the major credit card
companies withdrew as payment options for Backpage’s adult section advertisements in 2015.19 But this did little to slow the site’s
growth. Backpage responded by not only making basic advertisements free, but also accepting Bitcoin as payment for prime
placement.20 Bitcoin, the equally controversial internet-based currency, gained notoriety because it is untraceable, unregulated, and
exchanged exclusively online between private parties.21 This shift
had the unforeseen adverse effect of making it more difficult for
law enforcement officials to apprehend internet-based sex traffickers.22 Backpage’s adaptations dealt a huge blow to law enforcement
officials’ campaign against child sex trafficking because tracing
electronic transactions was no longer as viable of an investigative
technique.23

Decency Act of 1996.24 The Communications Decency Act of 1996
(CDA) was ratified by Congress in part to aid families in controlling
children’s exposure to objectionable material on the internet.25
Although portions of the CDA have been struck down as unconstitutional, Section 230 remains valid.26 Section 230’s original intent
was to allow internet service providers to “develop blocking and
filtering technologies” that inhibited a child’s access to sexually graphic material and to encourage the “vigorous” enforcement
of federal laws intended to obstruct and penalize the use of the
internet in furtherance of criminal behavior.27 Legislators offered
internet service providers immunity from state-level civil liability
that challenged efforts to effectuate CDA goals to shield minors
using the internet from sexually explicit content.28
Ironically, in practice, this provision continuously protects
internet service providers who host and profit from sex traffickers’ web-based advertisements.29 When determining Section 230’s
applicability, courts traditionally employ a three-pronged test
examining whether: (1) a defendant’s computer service was interactive; (2) a defendant was a content provider with respect to
the content at issue; and (3) the plaintiff’s allegations classify the
defendant as a “publisher or speaker” of the third-party content in
dispute.30 The third prong has become the most difficult obstacle

C.

Section 230: Internet Service Providers and Third-Party
Content

Section 230 of the CDA presents an insurmountable barrier for survivors seeking civil remedies against internet service
providers. Judicial interpretation has resulted in precedent that
continuously expands on the already sweeping applicability of
immunity.32 A plaintiff must show that an internet service provider created or edited content to a degree that it can be considered
a “content provider” and thus responsible for the content.33 This
requirement necessitates a degree of deletion, substitution, or suggestion that is difficult for a plaintiff to prove.34 There must then be
enough editorial control and behavior to label an internet service
provider a content provider.35
Under Section 230, internet service providers are immune
from liability for making good faith efforts to use or offer technology that restricts the accessibility or availability of objectionable
content, regardless of its constitutionality.36 But, subsequent case
law rapidly expanded Section 230’s breadth.37
courts follow).
31 See Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 331 (4th Cir. 1997) (The
court created a broad grant of immunity which is generally granted in tandem
with the party’s designation as a service provider. Given the ease of obtaining
this designation, service providers frequently enjoy the benefits of immunity
without an in-depth review of their practices).
32 See Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.
2003) (explaining that courts generally concur that Section 230 provides broad
immunity for third-party content).
33 See id. (noting that courts have adopted a “relatively expansive definition of ‘interactive computer service’” and a “relatively restrictive definition
of ‘information content provider’”). Accord Small Justice LLC v. Xcentric Ventures LLC, 99 F. Supp. 3d 190, 199–200 (D. Mass. 2015) (explaining that Section 230 did not bar suit because it arose from respondent’s own content—not
third-party content submitted in response).
34 See Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com,
LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1167–68 (9th Cir. 2008) (instructing that an internet service
provider cannot be deemed a content provider simply by supplementing content without materially contributing to its alleged illegality).

provider made relevant and material alterations of third-party content such
that they are a content provider within Section 230’s definition).

Though the CDA was originally introduced to stifle the proliferation of obscene material, Section 230 has served as the source of
authority to combat litigation seeking to remove allegedly obscene
third-party content.38 In Zeran v. America Online, Inc., the Fourth
Circuit indicated the strength of Section 230 immunity.39 On April
25, 1995, less than one week after the Oklahoma City Bombings,
an anonymous individual posted advertisements on a “Naughty
Oklahoma T-Shirts” web-based bulletin board.40 The post advertised shirts with slogans such as “Visit Oklahoma . . . It’s a blast!!!,”
“Putting the kids to bed . . . Oklahoma 1995,” and “McVeigh for
President 1996.”41 The post listed “Ken” as the point of contact to
purchase the shirts.42 Zeran reported the post to America Online
(AOL), which removed the ad the next day.43 Following removal,
a second post appeared the same day offering additional slogans
like “Finally a day care center that keeps the kids quiet—Oklahoma 1995,” again listing Zeran as the point of contact.44 Similar posts
appeared until May 1, 1995, and during this time Zeran received
violent, abusive, and threatening phone calls in response to the
notices.45 At its worst, Zeran received calls every two minutes, and
it was not until May 1995 that the calls subsided to roughly fifteen
per day.46 Though AOL removed the posts and terminated the
account, the internet service provider refused to issue a retraction.47
Zeran sued AOL alleging that the service provider’s response was
(explaining Section 230’s robustness and that “all doubts should be resolved in
favor of immunity”).

negligent and inadequate because of their knowledge about the
offensive posts.48
The court examined Section 230 and determined that
Congress’s intent was to insulate internet service providers from litigation stemming from third-party content that they did not develop
or create.49 The court explained that Section 230 bars lawsuits that
treat an internet service provider as a publisher.50 It opined that
distributor liability is merely a subset of publisher liability, each
falling within the collection of claims Section 230 precludes.51
Similarly, in Donato v. Moldow, the New Jersey Supreme
Court found that correcting, editing, or removing content were
permissible editorial functions that did not transform a service provider into a content provider.52 Moldow maintained a site where
he posted information about local government activities.53 His site
also permitted third-party users to anonymously post content in
discussion forums.54 Plaintiffs Vincent Donato and Gina Calogero
brought suit against Moldow alleging that some of those anonymous posts constituted, inter alia, defamation and harassment.55
The posts, from multiple anonymously-named users, falsely accused
Donato and Calogero of being, amongst other things, mentally
unstable, professionally corrupt, abusive of their power and authority, drug users, and generally untrustworthy.56 Though the users
themselves would be liable for their own content, plaintiffs argued
that because Moldow employed a series of filtering protocols and
engaged in conversations with the users, his role amounted to more

than that of a passive publisher.57 However, the court disagreed and
found that Moldow’s actions did not rise to a level of development
or creation that made him liable.58 The court further found that
dual status as a service provider and content provider is irrelevant
to immunity regarding third-party content, which ultimately hinged
on that specific content’s development.59
In Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, the Ninth Circuit found that Section 230 did not apply
if an internet service provider’s drop-down menus compelled users
to input prohibited information.60 The Roommates.com website
prompted users to give prohibited criteria including sexual orientation, gender, familial status, and race to build their profiles.61 The
internet service provider also formatted the site to limit searches
according to said prohibited criteria.62 The court found that the
service provider engaged in conduct that prompted users to create prohibited content and implemented tools that filtered in a
proscribed manner.63 Consequently, even as an internet service
provider, Roommates.com lost Section 230’s protections because it
played a material role in creating content.64
The Ninth Circuit distinguished between immunizable and
actionable content.65 In the same decision, it held Roommates.com
not liable for third-party content published in its original unedited state—the comments section of the page which permitted the
immediate posting of content in its unedited and unfiltered form.66
It was not actionable because Roommates.com had no role in

its development or creation as opposed to its direct control over
content created by way of drop-down menus that restricted the
content’s final form.67
Courts grappled with the ramifications of the CDA’s broad

a child sex trafficking victim brought suit in the Eastern District
of Missouri pursuant to, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. § 1595 and 18 U.S.C. §
2255.69 Latasha Jewell McFarland advertised the then-fourteen year
old M.A. on Backpage.com as an escort for sex.70 McFarland paid
Backpage to post advertisements that included pictures of M.A.’s
“private body parts in sexual pornographic poses.”71 In her complaint, M.A. contended that Backpage was an information content
provider under Section 230 because it was partially responsible for
“the development and/or creation of information provided through
the internet or other internet computer service.”72 M.A. cited multiple examples of Backpage’s promotional activity targeted at site
users, the most salient being their offering of “knowledge regarding how to post ads and pay anonymously” and implementation of
rules that “aid in the sight veiling of illegal sex services ads to create the veil of legality.”73 M.A. avoided alleging that Backpage was
more substantively responsible for the content of subject advertisements and argued instead that it built its success by catering to
such illicit advertisements to maximize profits.74 However, as the
court explained, the advertisements’ content was vital to its analysis

because the content was the basis for establishing M.A.’s standing
to prove a causal connection to the injuries suffered.75 The court
justified the grant of immunity to Backpage despite the immense
profits Backpage received from said advertisements because the
“mere operation of a website, without more, does not defeat [Section] 230 immunity.”76 The court further noted that doing so would
create a for-profit exception to Section 230, allowing liability to
attach based on an internet service provider’s profit-seeking strategies, be they morally acceptable or not, rather than their actual
relationship to the illicit content.77

Congress’s Response to Public Policy Values

Because of Section 230’s historically broad interpretation,
courts have issued decisions that conflict with core public policy
values, but nonetheless align with precedent.78 Indeed, courts have
often referred to Congress as the appropriate source of resolution
for this tension.79 In January 2017, Congress released a scathing
report entitled “Backpage.com’s Knowing Facilitation of Online
Sex Trafficking.”80 In its report, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs noted that Backpage has “invoked
Section 230 . . . to avoid criminal or civil responsibility for activities on the site.”81 The committee’s use of the word “responsibility”
rather than a term that suggests a more neutral view of the site’s
liability was notable because it alludes to Congress’s true intent for
Section 230 immunity.82
As its name indicates, Congress passed the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015 (SAVE Act) to combat

were not irrelevant to the question of Section 230 immunity despite M.A.’s

the increasing presence of trafficked children on the internet.83
The SAVE Act’s legislative history is rife with evidence of how
the advent of web-based advertisements cultivated the domestic
sex trafficking industry, especially as it pertains to children.84 With
this history in mind, Congress took painstaking efforts to strike a
blow at domestic sex trafficking without impeding First Amendment rights.85 Going too far would lead the SAVE Act down the
same path as overturned portions of the CDA.86 Instead, Congress
carefully tailored the SAVE Act to only go as far as is necessary to
eradicate illegal sex trafficking advertisements, so as not to erode
constitutional protections or Section 230 immunity.87

An Interpretation of Section 230 that Conflicts with, or Is

the Attendant Civil Remedies, Requires a Reading that Is
Inconsistent with the Plain Text of Section 230, and Thus
Should Not Stand
Misguided interpretations of Section 230 and the resulting common law principles have led to the unjust expansion of its
power. The plain meaning of Section 230(e)(1) sets out a clear and
unambiguous exception to immunity in that it specifically instructs
that “[n]othing in this section shall be construed to impair the

children) of Title 18, or any other Federal criminal statute.”88 Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, included in its entirety within Chapter 110,
provides a private right of action for victims of offenders who violate, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. § 1591.89 The SAVE Act has since amended
18 U.S.C. § 1591 to add advertising trafficked victims for commercial sex acts as criminally sanctionable.90 This additional language
was specifically inserted to criminalize the web-based classified
advertisements of sex-trafficked children.91 Moreover, 18 U.S.C. §
1595 states in relevant part that victims of a violation of the same
chapter “may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value
from participation in a venture which that person knew or should
have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter).”92
Importantly, the relevant sections are included amongst the federal
criminal statutes, intended to enforce or enhance federal criminal
statutes, and relate to combatting the sexual exploitation of children—each falling within the listed standards for an exception to
immunity.93 Thus, the perceived conflict between Section 230 and
civil liability stemming from these or similar federal criminal statutes is nonexistent.
Turning first to the plain text of the statutes, Congress chose
to apply civil liability against the perpetrator or anyone who knowingly benefits financially or otherwise.94 Additionally, in light of
Section 230’s explicit exception for enforcing federal criminal statutes, the chapter referenced in the text of 18 U.S.C. § 1595 includes

is a criminal statute within the plain meaning of the language Congress included in Section 230, and thus should not be precluded from
enforcement by Section 230 per the plain language of the statute.96
The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed that when interpreting a statute, courts presume the words of a statute serve a purpose
and Congress did not include superfluous language.97 To maintain the textual integrity of Section 230 itself, it must be read as a
whole because not doing so necessitates a presumption of textual
superfluity.98 Therefore, liability imposed to enforce these federal criminal statutes, especially those statutes relating to the sexual
exploitation of children, should not be precluded by Section 230
because this interpretation is in clear conflict with the text, as the
text directly references the criminal statutes.99
The attendant civil remedies, which create the federal private
right of action for victims, were presumably added by Congress for
a salient and meaningful purpose.100 It is logical and reasonable
to infer that that purpose is primarily, if not entirely, devoted to
the enforcement of the federal criminal statutes with which they
are surrounded and clearly associated.101 Congress’s decision to
include them within Title 18, devoted to crimes and criminal procedure, supports this inference.102 An overly broad interpretation of
Section 230 to limit these civil remedies undermines their integrity
and enforcement as part of the criminal code.103 Such an interpre96 See 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(1) (2012) (defining the extent of Section 230’s
effect on state or criminal law without further distinguishing or excluding language signifying their ascription to the plain and common understanding of

98 See Abramski v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 2259, 2267 (2014) (instructing that the language of a statute should not be considered in a “vacuum” but

tation undermines their specific fundamental policy and purpose
as well, which is wholly consistent with the expressed exceptions
to Section 230 immunity.104 An interpretation that limits civil remedy is untenable, as it goes against the plain language of Section
230 and frustrates the enforcement of federal criminal statutes specifically intended to prevent the sexual exploitation of children.105
Accordingly, the line of cases, including Doe v. Backpage, interpreting Section 230 as precluding civil liability for advertising sexually
exploited children is inconsistent with the statute’s plain meaning.106
Moreover, these cases were decided before Congress’s Committee Report was published in January 2017, and therefore, each
case was decided without knowledge of Backpage’s editing or
development practices.107 The litigants could not show that the
respective defendant service providers had been convicted pursuant to one of the subject criminal statutes.108 Each litigant concedes
that the illegality of the advertisements is based on content provided by a third party.109 That third party is completely susceptible to
or any other federal criminal statute).
104 Compare 47 U.S.C. § 230(b)(5) (2012) (declaring that laws be vigorously enforced to deter and punish those using computers to engage in the
trafficking of, inter alia, obscenity) and 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(1) (2012) (listing laws
relating to the sexual exploitation of children, more specifically, those in Chapter 110 of Title 18, as excepted from § 230 immunity), with 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a)
(2012) (instructing that victims of offenders who violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591 may
bring suit against that offender).
105 See Levin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 511–14 (2013) (relying on
the similarities of the plain language in two statutes to reject an interpretation of the earlier enacted statute that would render enforcement of the latter
inoperable).
106 Cf. Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 543–44 (1994) (instructing that common-law principles are to be followed and given deference
when the statute is silent, but remain subject to the text of the statute as authorized by Congress). Section 230 explicitly states that its grant of immunity
is not intended to interfere with the enforcement of federal criminal statutes,
especially those pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children. Thus, the statute is not silent as to its applicability in cases where federal criminal statutes
criminalize the sexual exploitation of children.

convicted.110
An adjudicated violation is a crucial element to proving
standing because, to properly bring suit, a plaintiff must be a victim of a violation perpetrated by the internet service provider as an
illicit advertiser.111 Essentially, then, the internet service provider
must become a content provider.112 This designation should already
place them outside the protection of Section 230 immunity.113 However, as an advertiser of sex-trafficked children, Backpage should be
susceptible to the enforcement of said statutes and their attendant
civil remedies which, by their plain language, prohibit the precise
behavior referenced as a reason to except them from Section 230
immunity.114 The First Circuit’s interpretation of Section 230 would

meant to enhance punishment as part of their enforcement.115 This

a reasonable doubt, and an elevated mens rea standard, knowledge,
but still be precluded from enforcement.116
Consequently, the line of cases which interpret Section 230 as
offering immunity to civil liability for manually editing and posting
illegal advertisements for sex trafficked children are untenable.117
Each court relied upon a reading of Section 230 that is inconsistent with the plain meaning of its limitations.118 They frustrate the
enforcement of Title 18 Chapter 110, expressly listed as an area of
law with which Section 230 should not interfere, by preventing suit
under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.119 These cases also rely upon an interpretation that frustrates the enforcement of 18 U.S.C. § 1595, which is
directly related to the sexual exploitation of children, as its viability as a remedy depends on a conviction for activity involving the
exploitation of children.120 Preventing the sexual exploitation of
children is a purpose specifically conveyed by Congress in the plain
language of Section 230.121 Thus, courts should not follow the line
of cases which rely upon an interpretation of Section 230 that goes
against its plain language.122
116 Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (2012) (relying on a violation of a criminal
statute for remedy) and 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (2012) (relying on a violation of a
criminal statute for remedy), with Doe, 817 F.3d at 23 (mistaking the applicable
standard of proof that would give rise to civil remedy because it is dependent
upon a finding of guilt pursuant to a criminal statute). Because civil liability
only attaches once a criminal case is successfully prosecuted, plaintiffs carry
a higher burden in their claims for relief. Thus, the rush of lawsuits often fabled by Section 230 supporters are actually less likely to occur than they have
suggested.

The SAVE Act’s implementation was a clear demonstration
of Congress’s attempt to hold internet service providers liable when
they advertise or garner profits from advertisements that feature
sexually exploited children.123 Congress was readily aware of Section 230 and its precedent when they implemented the SAVE Act.124
Notably, Congress decided not to include language in the SAVE
Act that precluded immunity under Section 230, as they conspicuously included language in Section 230 that precluded interference
with federal criminal statutes.125 Presuming that the presence or
absence of language within a statute is purposeful, it is significant
that Section 230 lacks language instructing that the statute precludes the enforcement of a federal criminal statute’s attendant
civil remedies.126 Had Congress intended for internet service providers to be immune from the SAVE Act’s concomitant penalties,
they presumably would have stated this intention, just as they stated that internet service providers be immune from state-level civil
liability in the text of Section 230.127

the protection of Section 230 immunity.130 It would be unreasonable
to attach liability to all degrees of editing.131 Provided an internet
service provider limits its manipulation of third-party content to
neutral categories or purposes of editing, like correcting grammar
and spelling, or deleting obscenities and profanity, they will and
should retain the protection of Section 230 immunity.132 By limiting
their manipulation in this manner, they maintain their relative status as a neutral conduit for third-party content.133 Once an internet
service provider’s editing is meant to or does materially alter the
content at issue, Section 230 immunity becomes inappropriate.134
Consider, for example, the following circumstances. A third party
submits the following advertisement for publication on an internet
service provider’s website: “Mary is seling cocaine for 20.” As an
entirely neutral conduit, the internet service provider should publish the content just as it was submitted, spelling error included, and
easily retain the protections of Section 230.135 This is similar to the

Suppose the internet service provider alters the content to
promote readability and ultimately decides to post: “Mary is selling cocaine for $20.” The internet service provider will likely retain
Section 230 immunity.137 This is because the service provider has not
materially altered the submitted content from its original state.138
More importantly, the editing does not modify or veil the advertisement’s purpose.139 The service provider has merely engaged in an
arguably traditional editorial function meant to promote readability and clarity.140
But, if the internet service provider changes the post as follows, the editorial functions have moved past the precipice of
neutrality: “Mary is seling ______ for $20.”, or “Mary is selling packs
of hot cocoa for $20.”141 This editing materially alters the content
such that what was once illicit is now falsely presented as innocuous to circumvent law enforcement detection, yet still capable
of achieving the ultimate illegal goal of facilitating the intended
unlawful transaction.142

carefully selected words and phrases to subvert law enforcement
investigations.144 The edits did not merely remove obscenities, make
minor corrections to word choice, or promote clarity, readability, or
palatability—they removed evidence.145
Backpage’s editing practices differ from these acceptable
forms of editing because they serve an arguably illegal purpose—
obstructing police detection of illicit behavior.146 Unlike other
acceptable forms, this is not neutral manipulation of the content to
facilitate publication.147 Once an internet service provider engages in editing for a purpose aside from those traditionally associated
with the dissemination of material to the general public, its involvement with the development and production of that content rises to
that of a content provider.148 This juncture is pivotal in determining
whether an internet service provider has effectively transformed
into a content provider and shed the attendant shield of Section
230 immunity.149 Here, Backpage’s behavior materially alters the
content in that it veils the illicit intent of the content.150 Development or substantive manipulation of the subject content, whether
meant to conceal illegality or not, is not behavior that falls within
the scope of Section 230 immunity.151

would again constitute a permissible editorial function.152 The
paradigmatic illegal language showing the actual nature of the
transaction to law enforcement is intentionally shorn.153 Moderators, Backpage employees responsible for reviewing ads, were
instructed to remove words or phrases indicative of illegality.154
Words like “lolita,” “teenage,” “amber alert,” and “little girl” would
be filtered out, either manually by a moderator or automatically by
Backpage’s Strip Term From Ad filter software, and the ad would be
posted in its redacted form.155
This alteration materially contributes to the development
of the content, specifically illegal content, because it creates the
appearance of legality, once absent from the content, and ensures
the illegal operation moves forward.156 Thus, the alteration contributes a characteristic that the content would not otherwise have, but
for the editing of Backpage.157
Backpage has similarly materially edited third-party content
by veiling the indicia of illegality and thus ostensibly cleansing the
content of its illegality.158 Just as editing to create or develop illegal

the content’s illegality, would transform an internet service provider into an information content provider and vitiate immunity, so
too should development by way of veiling illegality.159 The internet
service provider’s understanding of the illicit nature of the content
is what prompts the deletion, not a desire to further an acceptable
publication goal.160
This purpose and degree of editing amounts to more than that
of a passive intermediary since it is directly connected and driven
by the intent to veil the content’s illegality.161 Backpage executives’
instructions to employees to remove evidence of the illicit transactions so that advertisements appear innocuous to law enforcement
despite their meretricious roots are indeed illegal.162 Congress’s
explicitly stated intent to shield internet service providers from civil
liability for good faith editing practices could not reasonably have
been meant to include the this conduct.163 Congress intended to
immunize good faith editing practices from civil liability, especially
those designed to filter out obscene or illegal material.164 Congress
also intended to immunize the inverse—editing or filtering practices that failed to filter obscene or illegal material.165 To posit that
Congress intended for immunity to extend to practices that intentionally frustrated the enforcement of federal criminal statutes is
unacceptable because it requires the absurd result that Congress
intended to immunize illegal behavior that it deemed actionable
within the same statute.166

The First Circuit’s Decision is Untenable Given the Revelation
of New, Material Facts that Make Backpage a Content
Provider, Within the Section 230 Definition

The reasoning relied upon by the First Circuit in Doe v. Backpage is inapplicable given the introduction of new evidence that
Backpage used editorial practices which materially contributed to
concealing the submitted content’s illegality.167 Limited to their minimal knowledge of Backpage’s editing practices, plaintiffs conceded
the first two prongs of Section 230’s three-part test, seeking only
to challenge Section 230 immunity by attacking its third prong.168
However, the second prong mandates immunity if plaintiffs base
their suit on content provided by a third-party content provider.169
In light of the new evidence revealing material information about
Backpage’s editorial practices, the second prong justifying immunity is unfulfilled.170 Thus, Backpage is a content provider within
Section 230’s definition of the term.171
Under Section 230, a party may be deemed an information
content provider for even contributing to the development of
content “in part.”172 The purpose and degree of manual editing,
including the deliberate removal of key child sex trafficking terms
to avoid law enforcement detection, defeats this limitation.173 Backpage’s role in the sex trafficking enterprise is like an intermediary

unbeknownst to said pimp or trafficker, changes the language to
avoid using actionable language while the ultimate goal remains
intact.174 Backpage’s development of the content is similarly essential to serve its purpose as the impetus for an illegal transaction.175
But for the deletion of language indicative of the illegal intent, the
content would be subject to potentially immobilizing scrutiny.176
The editing decisions were initiated and completely controlled by
Backpage.177 Consequently, the published content at issue is in part
developed by Backpage.178
An argument that Backpage’s editing practices were part
and parcel of the construction and operation of its own website
are flawed at best.179 Backpage’s editing practices were not implemented to prevent the presence of those specific words throughout
the site as though they are categorically offensive or obscene.180
The presence of words and phrases that were filtered out of the
adult section in advertisements hosted in the other sections of
Backpage’s website validates this assertion.181 Unlike previously-recognized, traditional editing practices implemented to prevent
the presence of obscene or offensive content on the internet, these
editing practices were employed to avoid law enforcement detection by removing cryptic yet detectable signs of child sex trafficking
and exploitation.182 These concerted efforts were made to facilitate

the surreptitious posting of sex trafficking advertisements—not to
filter or passively permit their publication with minimally obscene
or offensive language.183 Filtering or passively permitting publication would merit immunity.184 To the contrary, Backpage specifically
sought to post illegal content in a manner it thought would best
avoid law enforcement detection.185 Avoiding law enforcement
detection while engaging in illegal activity is not a purpose for website construction or operation that is statutorily immunizable.186
Despite Section 230’s broad application, immunity explicitly stops
short of protecting illegal activity.187
In deciding Doe v. Backpage, the First Circuit relied in large
part upon Universal Communication Systems, Inc. v. Lycos,188 which
was their first experience construing Section 230 immunity.189 However, defendants in Lycos were not alleged to have materially altered
the actual content at issue.190 Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants
facilitated the proliferation of the illicit content at issue via their
website’s policies and construction because they permitted the creation of multiple accounts and free posting.191 The alleged conduct
at issue is fundamentally distinguishable from the behavior Backtraditional editorial functions and explaining that filtering for obscene material

page engaged in: the obviously targeted and systematic removal of
language indicative of illegal behavior to avoid law enforcement.192
This type of editorial behavior is analogous to the development of
illegal content as sanctioned in Roommates.com because Backpage
has materially contributed to the illegality of the content by making
edits as they deem necessary to avoid law enforcement detection.193
In this case, the trial court was mistaken in its assertion that
Backpage’s actions were merely that of a passive or imperfect “filtering system,” as was the plaintiff in conceding the second prong of
the three-part test.194 Had the plaintiffs known of Backpage’s editorial practices, they would have been able to assert more credibly
that Backpage was responsible for generating content.195 Contrary to the court’s assertion, Backpage’s practices are “affirmative
participation” by way of “active web content creation” in that the
illegality is purposefully secreted from law enforcement because
Backpage has deemed it necessary to do so.196 Furthermore, the
content is not a mere excerpt from the original content submitted
by the third party, as the court asserted.197 Instead, it is the content
that Backpage developed per its standards and preferences.198

buyers for sex-trafficked minors.208 This type of content is, by definition, illegal.209 Publication of this illegal content, and editorial
functions used to facilitate its undetected proliferation, are protected neither by the First Amendment nor Section 230.210
Because neither the content at issue nor the editorial practices are constitutionally protected or immunizable under Section
230, Backpage should be liable for the illicit content it edited and
subsequently published.211 It is evident, based on Backpage’s imposition of its editorial preferences for the individual ads, that they
are a content provider.212 Since the First Circuit and the plaintiffs
were limited in their knowledge of Backpage’s editorial practices,
the court’s decision was appropriate only to the extent that they
reached it based on a materially incomplete record that did not
consider the extensive amount of manual editing that occurred.213

applicable to current legal issues that are dependent upon its interpretation.215 In Roommates.com, the Ninth Circuit opined that
liability need not have its genesis in the original text, but can develop from materially contributing a characteristic to the content.216
Conversely, an originalist interpretation of Section 230 is wholly
inappropriate because it must be based upon legislative goals and
societal circumstances in existence at the time of implementation
that, at least with respect to Section 230 and the internet, have since
become outdated.217 The vital goal of protecting the then-fledgling
internet is no longer valid, as its novel and disparate characteristics
have since dissipated.218 The internet is now a fully-developed component of society.219 Thus, this aspect of the CDA’s original purpose
is not as pertinent as it was when Section 230 was implemented.220

III. Policy Recommendation
Congress should amend Section 230 to rectify the conflict and
ambiguity surrounding its applicability.221 The plain text of Section
230 shows that Congress did not intend for it to impair the enforcement of statutes preventing the sexual exploitation of children or
any other federal criminal statute.222 Civil remedies under § 1595
meet both of these expressed exceptions because they are materially associated with the enforcement of federal criminal statutes
215 See, e.g., Roommates.com, 521 F.3d at 1164 n.15 (explaining that the
internet’s fragility has subsided such that enforcing the elevated laws is reasonable, but its integral role in society necessitates caution when expanding the
scope of the immunity).
216 See, e.g., id. at 1167–68, 72 (explaining service providers may be liable
for content originating from a third party when the service provider contributes
to the content’s illegality).
217 Cf. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 165 F.3d 952, 958 (D.C. Cir. 1999)
(professing that outdated statutes are appropriately remedied through legislative action). Accord Taber v. Maine, 45 F.3d 598, 607 (2d Cir. 1995) (expressing
that it is occasionally appropriate for the judiciary to urge legislators to remedy
outdated statutes).

internet could realistically be substantively repressed by increased government
involvement).

presence).
220 See id. (doubting that enforcement could necessitate the protection
legislation originally felt appropriate).
221 See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(b)(1) (2012) (declaring that civil actions pursuant to § 1595 will be held in abeyance, while criminal proceedings resulting from
the same offense are pending).

that seek to prevent the sexual exploitation of children.223 Furthermore, viability of suit is reliant upon an adjudication of guilt in a
trial court and is stayed until such time.224 The section applicable
to internet service providers, § 1591, requires proof of the highest
level of intent: knowingly. This mens rea standard is sufficiently elevated such that upon a finding of guilt it is reasonable and just that
a claim should lie against the perpetrator.225 The requirement that
civil action necessitates a finding of guilt prevents the inundation of
civil suits Congress wanted to avoid.226
Which factors contribute to a determination of intent must
be clear to ensure that fluctuating interpretations of editorial functions remain consistent. Because criminal law necessitates strict
and uniform interpretations, internet service providers will be
provided clear notice as to what functions may lead to a finding
of guilt. This will help internet service providers construct filtering technology and programs that better ensure their compliance
with the law. Consequently, such an amendment avoids a chilling
effect because internet service providers will have clear knowledge
of what actions trigger liability and what actions will remain protected by Section 230.
Also, a limited amendment to the CDA will not infringe upon
the First Amendment rights of consenting adults to post web-based
advertisements or on internet service providers’ right to host their
advertisements.227 A limited and properly tailored exception that
is triggered upon criminal conviction is not only necessary, but the
most appropriate course of action. By limiting liability, criminal
or civil, to advertisements that are fundamentally illegal, and thus
not protected, the First Amendment privileges of parties engaging in permissible exchanges will remain untouched.228 Meanwhile,

offenders responsible for the creation or development of illegal
advertisements would be fully susceptible to the civil and criminal
penalties specifically implemented to combat that behavior.
A.

Current Section 230 Policy
As written, Section 230 already permits criminal prosecution and civil action against Backpage.229 This is primarily because
the illegality of Backpage’s editorial practices was so systemic and
egregious.230 Yet, it is still unclear when their actions crossed the
precipice of legality because the interconnection between the two
relevant pieces of legislation is not clear.231 In light of the U.S.
Senate’s recommendation that the Department of Justice pursue
criminal charges, judicial officers will likely soon have the opportunity to not only clarify but limit the circumstances of when Sections
1591 and 1595 yield to Section 230. Still, despite having the power
it needs to punish Backpage, the confusion and controversy surrounding Section 230 calls for clarifying legislation.232
The spectrum of actionable behavior is currently unclear
because current legislation does not clearly define the interconnection between Section 230 and Sections 1591 and 1595.233 Backpage’s
editorial practices were egregious, marking the far end of a theoretical tripartite spectrum. For ease of differentiation, that third can
be considered clearly culpable conduct. This would include conduct that undoubtedly vitiates Section 230 immunity—substantive
not afforded First Amendment protection[]”) (citing U.S. v. Williams, 553 U.S.
285, 297 (2008)).

editing, purposeful concealment of criminal activity, or other similarly subversive actions.234 At the complete opposite end of that
spectrum is clearly inculpable conduct, namely conduct that is
completely aligned with Section 230 requirements and the law
generally.235 Making up the largest portion of this spectrum is the
conduct that does not clearly fall in either of those two described
groups. This will undoubtedly be the conduct that develops the
nuances of Section 230’s common law doctrine as it pertains to Sections 1591 and 1595.236 But, judicial precedent must grow from lucid
legislation that clearly defines the interconnection between them,
as well as their boundaries, power, and scope.237
To effectively address the problematic lack of clarity, new legislation must clarify (1) when Section 230 yields to federal criminal
and civil law, especially Sections 1591 and 1595; (2) what conduct,
be it an action or inaction, constitutes an actionable violation of
18 U.S.C. § 1591; (3) what Good Samaritan blocking and screening
efforts will not expose service providers to liability; (4) what level
of scienter dissolves Section 230 immunity; and (5) what acceptable
forms of state-level legislation will overcome Section 230. Clarity regarding each of these points is necessary to strike a balance
between supporting free speech and innovation on the internet,
and preventing the proliferation of illicit content.
B.

Congress’s 2017 Proposed Legislation

In 2017, Congress made three attempts to strike this balance
with three pieces of legislation specifically geared at preventing
websites that facilitate sex trafficking from leveraging Section 230
immunity to avoid civil and criminal liability.238 Each piece of leg234 See 18 U.S.C. 1591(a) (2012) (listing the breadth of criminally culpable behavior that constitutes a punishable offense); 47 U.S.C. 230(e)(1) (2012)
(explaining that the subject statute has no effect on criminal law).

islation begins by explicitly clarifying that Section 230 was never
meant to shield service providers from legal liability when they
engage in conduct that facilitates sex trafficking.239 Each one also
proposes amendments to Section 230 and 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to clarify what constitutes violative conduct for service providers.240 More
specifically, the proposed language defines “participation in a venture,” arguably the most pivotal phrase between both pieces of
legislation for service providers.241 It is pivotal primarily because
it serves as the basis for determining what degree of tangential
involvement triggers culpability. Currently it is unclear, but the
purpose of the proposed language is to clarify what actions or connections cross the threshold into liability.
In April, House Representative Ann Wagner introduced the
Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of
2017 (House Bill 1865).242 Congresswoman Wagner’s proposed
changes to Section 230 ensure the availability of a civil remedy and
victim restitution, and create a broad exception for any state-level criminal or civil statutes targeted at sex trafficking or the sexual
exploitation of children.243 House Bill 1865 also waives the prosecutor’s and plaintiff’s burden of proving intent in any criminal or
civil action.244 However, the crux of its ambiguity is in the bill’s
sweeping characterization of culpable conduct.245 House Bill 1865
proposes changes to § 1591 that create publisher liability for service providers that host content with “reckless disregard” for that
content’s innate goal of facilitating a § 1591(a) violation.246 The bill
also significantly broadens the definition of the key term “participation in a venture.”247 Representative Wagner proposes it is the
“knowing or reckless conduct by any person or entity and by any
means that furthers or in anyway aids or abets the violation of subsection (a)(1).”248

[Vol. 25.45

While certainly laudable in its intent, House Bill 1865 goes
too far. Though it clarifies how the pieces of legislation are interrelated, the pendulum of favor swings too far from center, making
the threshold of scienter too low.249 In House Bill 1865’s version, if
a service provider has even the slightest knowledge that their website is being abused they can be deemed as having participated in
a venture.250 The language is so sweeping in its characterization of
culpable conduct that there’s no predictability in its application.
Predictability is a fundamental characteristic of the justice system
that every piece of legislation should have, both for the benefit of
the aggrieved and the accused.251 Service providers must be able
to develop internal screening, editorial, and publishing policies to
avoid criminal or civil liability. Under House Bill 1865’s definition,
the safest approach for a service provider with any knowledge that
their website has been used for an illegal venture is to shut it down,
since only knowledge and not intent is necessary to sustain a prosecution or civil action. The ripple effect would undoubtedly have a
chilling effect on the internet beyond reason.
In August 2017, Senator Rob Portman put forth the Stop
Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA).252 SESTA better clarifies and balances the relationships between Section 230’s breadth,
the CDA’s original intent, and the SAVE Act.253 SESTA excludes
state-level criminal and civil statutes targeting sex trafficking from
Section 230 immunity, and explicitly declares that Section 230 shall
have no effect on the civil remedies 18 U.S.C. § 1595 permits.254 But,
similar to House Bill 1865, SESTA does not offer enough limiting or guiding language regarding the substance of newly excluded
state laws.255 While it does exclude state law targeting sex trafficking, it does not limit the scope of culpable behavior that may be

criminalized or to what degree they must be related to sex trafficking.256 Thus, culpable behavior can be redefined and vastly different
from state to state, yet convictions or civil actions pursuant to each
excluded from Section 230 immunity.257
SESTA also has a better definition of the pivotal phrase “participation in a venture.”258 SESTA’s definition hammers down the
definition of culpable conduct with a greater degree of specificity than House Bill 1865.259 SESTA describes what would lead to
criminal or civil liability as “knowing conduct by an individual or
entity, by any means, that assists, supports, or facilitates a violation
of subsection (a)(1).”260 As compared to House Bill 1865, this puts
forth a narrower scope of conduct that is centered on a service provider’s knowledge of illicit behavior.261 Although SESTA narrows
and specifies the exceptions to Section 230, it leaves a wide range
of internet service providers susceptible to liability for actions not
clearly intended to facilitate, or recklessly disregard, illicit activities
taking place via their website.262 It remains unclear what degree of
knowledge would trigger liability.263 Moreover, granting exceptions
for state-level legislation exposes service providers to inconsistences and unpredictability in liability from state to state. Consequently,
service providers cannot reasonably prepare and employ responsible screening and editorial methods to avoid liability.
256 See S. 1693 § 3(a)(2).
257 See id. Without limitations or guidelines for culpable behavior states
are free to craft their legislation to sweep as broadly or as narrowly as possible.
An example of this would be if State A crafts legislation that includes passive
hosting of illegal third-party content, while State B limits culpability to conduct
that adds text to third-party content, and State C limits culpable conduct to that
barred only by federal statute. A service provider present in each state would
be subject to liability for vastly different levels of development as it pertains to
third-party content. Given the expansiveness of the internet and the breadth
of material transmitted it would be impossible for an internet service provider
to cater to each state’s varying legislation without prompting extreme, if not
complete, censorship.
258 See S. 1693 § 4(2).
259 Compare H.R. 1865 § 4(a)(2) (defining “participation in a venture”
using language to make it as expansive as possible), with S. 1693 § 4(2) (defining
the same term with targeted and specific language).
260 S. 1693 § 4(2).
261 Compare H.R. 1865 § 4(a)(2)–(3) (proposing an inclusive definition, but removing the requirement of intent for prosecutors and plaintiffs),

conduct”).
262 See S. 1693 § 4(2) (indicating that service providers must engage in
“knowing conduct” that “assists, supports, or facilitates” but without describing
the degree of knowledge that fulfills this element).

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

[Vol. 25.45

In November 2017, Senator John Thune introduced an amended version of SESTA that lessened the breadth of exceptions to
Section 230 immunity and earned the Internet Association’s support.264 Senator Thune’s proposed amendments to Section 230 and
Sections 1591 and 1595 that offered greater specificity and tailoring
than Congresswoman Wagner’s and Senator Portman’s proposals.265
Senator Thune’s version similarly defines “participation in a venture” as “knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation
of subsection (a)(1).”266 But more importantly, it narrows actionable claims to those brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595 for actions
that violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591, eliminating the unpredictability of
state level litigation that Congresswoman Wagner’s and Senator
Portman’s proposals would allow.267
Another key part of Senator Thune’s amended version of
SESTA provides limiting guidance for state-level actions that
Congresswoman Wagner and Senator Portman’s versions lack.268
Thune’s amended version of SESTA declares that a state-level
criminal prosecution must be based on conduct that “constitutes
a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1595].”269 This draws a clear boundary
on actionable state-level legislation. With this limitation, states
will not have the freedom to impose laws that criminalize behavior
beyond what 18 U.S.C. § 1595 criminalizes.
Senator Thune’s version further proposes that 18 U.S.C. §
1595 be amended to permit state attorney generals, acting as parens
patriae, to sue individuals who violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591 on behalf
of the state’s residents.270 Indeed, a state may recover damages or
other such relief for its affected citizens. This is key in that it would
eliminate several “frivolous” law suits that many of SESTA’s critics frequently cite as a primary reason to oppose any change to
Section 230.271

Proposed Amendments

While each version adds a level of specificity about actionable behavior, none of the proposed legislation makes it sufficiently
clear what conduct is actionable, what degree of scienter vitiates
immunity in civil actions, and lastly what types of Good Samaritan blocking will not expose service providers to liability. In each
version, the vagueness of proposed definitions for “participation
in a venture” leaves too much room for confusion and misapplication. The bills do not give adequate notice of what would vitiate
a service provider’s immunity. The phrases, whether used in conjunction or independently, are too vague. On the other hand,
making the legislation overly specific would make it so narrow that
it would essentially have no force and effect. Effective legislation
must strike the balance between specificity and generality. Senator
Thune’s version does this best primarily because it offers the most
salient basis from which service providers can craft practices. Still,
the law’s nuances must be borne out in practice and fine-tuned over
time. Essentially, there must be a post-SESTA Zeran before Section 230’s new breadth of applicability becomes clear.272
While each version clarifies that Section 230 yields to Sections 1591 and 1595, and that state-level legislation is excepted from
Section 230 immunity, Section 230 should further specify its limits.
While Senator Thune’s version of SESTA has garnered the support
of major tech industry members, specificity would better serve its
goal.273 The following suggested edits are a better situated starting point for legislators, survivors, and service providers to reach
satisfactory common ground and develop mutually agreeable solutions. A sixth section should be added to 47 U.S.C. § 230(b) stating:
to ensure vigorous enforcement of federal criminal and civil law
directly relating to sex trafficking facilitated by means of any webbased platform. Next, 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) should be amended as
follows: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall
be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided
by another information content provider unless: (1) that information has been substantively modified by that interactive computer
service provider or user or (2) that provider or user has intentionally

concealed, censored, or obscured illegal information in a manner
that prevents detection or otherwise obstructs justice in any way. A
third section should be added to 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2) that states:
any significant and meaningful action taken in good faith to stop
the proliferation of illicit content, especially advertisements for sex
trafficked individuals.
With this suggested language, Senator Thune’s definition of
“participation in a venture” rises from palatable to practicable. Section 230, and Sections 1591 and 1595 can easily work in tandem,
rather than at odds. While the definition of “participation in a venture” sweeps broader than courts’ previous interpretations, Section
230 would be sufficiently specific and targeted to prevent Sections
1591 and 1595’s arbitrary enforcement against service providers.274
However, limiting guidance for the definition will prevent prohibitive censoring or a mass exodus of service providers seeking to
avoid the risk of liability. This would be best served by the addition
of brief but illustrative safe harbor and unsafe harbor provisions.
While the safe harbor provision should be specific and detailed in
what is included, the unsafe harbor should be explicit in indicating
that the described conduct is merely illustrative and not exhaustive.

Conclusion
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has experienced an unjust expansion to protect untenable behavior. Since its
implementation, its breadth of influence and governance has continuously grown. Now, the immunity originally intended to foster
technological growth while shielding children has morphed into
a disturbing and bizarre version of itself. Congress’s hesitance to
reign in its breadth has led to a public policy tension that requires
resolution. Seeking to avoid the undesired result of chilling and
censoring the internet, Congress has relied on minimalist, piecemeal approaches to create some semblance of connectivity and
complement.
Doe v. Backpage is evidence of the lapse in Congress’s
efforts.275 The SAVE Act clearly criminalizes the knowing advertisement of sex trafficked minors and serves as the necessary

that the pivotal phrase “participation in a venture” had yet to be explicitly interpreted, however, precedent established the narrow interpretation this Court
relied upon to rule in favor of defendants. By contrast, proposed definitions
present a broader interpretation of the term which includes conduct beyond
the “publisher or speaker” designation).

Congress’s efforts with Section 230 and 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1595).

catalytic groundwork for certain federally mandated private rights
of action.276 Despite compelling evidence to the contrary, this right
of action was proscribed by the First Circuit.277 However, the current legislative milieu is marked by a developing congressional
interest in crippling internet service providers that brazenly aid the
sexual exploitation of children, while feigning concern about its
proliferation. Given the discovery of vitally germane evidence of
editing practices, it is now more appropriate than ever to respond
by criminalizing such behavior. It must be made clear that Section 230 is not, and more importantly never was, intended to shield
such practices from criminal or civil liability. This will establish the
most appropriate and impactful form of justice that trafficking survivors deserve.

Goodlatte) (explaining the purpose for the SAVE Act as providing a penalty
for “knowingly selling advertising” of victims of sexual exploitation).
277 See Doe, 817 F.3d at 29 (acknowledging that the arguments in favor of
holding Backpage liable for its role in furthering sex trafficking were persuasive
but did not overcome the CDA immunity).
