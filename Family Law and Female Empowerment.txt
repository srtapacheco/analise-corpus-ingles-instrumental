EMPOWERMENT

“Ball buster.” “Soul crusher.” “Whimpy whiner.”1 Feminism,
still a dirty word in many American circles, has certainly endured
its share of castigation. Many men run scared when it is uttered.
Women frequently shun it. Those who choose to embrace it are routinely criticized.2
The feminist movement has been slow to start and has spanned
decades. However, things appear to be shifting. Today, many argue
that feminism has found a new stride, a fourth wave. The globalization of culture fostered by the Internet has, in large part, sparked
this new wave. “[I]t is increasingly clear that the Internet has facilitated the creation of a global community of feminists who use [it]
both for discussion and activism.”3
Social media has made it cool to be a feminist. Emma Watson’s United Nations speech as spokeswoman for HeForShe, an
international gender equality campaign, went viral, receiving more
than seven million views on YouTube.4 The response to this video

exemplifies the burgeoning discussion of modern feminism in the
internet age.
Family law remains a striking exception. Domestic relations
law has struggled with feminism for decades, and it has never truly
found a place in the family law arena. The crux of the problem, no
doubt, is that family law has always had a difficult time defining
feminism in context. From an economic perspective, is it feminist
to provide economic assistance to women, who studies continue to
show suffer far more than do their male counterparts in the wake
of divorce? Or does feminism instead require a recognition of the
ability of women to make equivalent financial contributions to a
marriage as men, and thereby accept only pure equality of treatment? A series of incongruent doctrines makes it clear that family
law truly does not know what feminism should mean.
Consequently, the system of family law largely fails to achieve
one of feminism’s most fundamental tenets: empowerment. This
Article will sample a diverse cross-section of family law and analyze it from a feminist perspective. Part I will consider the state of
a woman’s decision-making authority in the reproductive context.
Parts II and III will explore the modern proliferation of domestic
violence-related legislation, analyzing state law schemes that provide for both punitive damage recoveries and permanent spousal
support. Part IV will address marital property regimes around the
country. Across all contexts, the Article will demonstrate that, often
despite the best intentions of legislators and jurists, family law
wholly fails to empower women.
What results is a system of modern family law that has become
increasingly anti-feminist. As this fourth wave of feminism dawns,
family law has a rare chance to respond appropriately to feminist
concerns. Women across the United States are depending on it.
I. Reproductive Decision-making: Women
as Non-Autonomous Persons
It has long been recognized that laws regulating women’s
choices in the reproductive sphere achieve a result far short of
empowerment.5 From the pre-Roe v. Wade era to today, women
suffer more intrusions upon their reproductive decisions than do
men.6 As reproductive technology has continued to develop, the

non-traditional family has become more prevalent. More forms
of parenting have become possible, but family law has not simultaneously evolved to advance the interests of women. This trend
is clear in modern surrogacy and second-parent-egg-donation. In
both instances, American law has continued in a direction that does
not support women’s reproductive choices, sending a powerful message about just how valuable those choices are.

A.

Surrogacy: A Protectionist Regime
Surrogacy exploded onto the American reproductive scene in
the late 1980s, shortly after the first successful in-vitro fertilization
in the United States made it a new avenue for addressing female
infertility.8 Before the close of the decade, state supreme courts had
to grapple with difficult custody, contractual, and parentage issues
raised by parties to surrogacy contracts gone awry.9
At the outset of the surrogacy debate, many states simply
refused to recognize or enforce surrogacy agreements of any kind.10
Thus, if the intended parents breached the contract, surrogates
were left with no means of enforcement.11 Likewise, should the
surrogate choose to renege on the contract to parent the resulting
child, intended parents generally found themselves with no legal
recourse to enforce their contractual agreements.12 In both the traditional and gestational forms of surrogacy, the courts refused to
honor both the reproductive choices of the intended mother and
those of the surrogate.13

This result was not surprising in the 1980s, as the technology
supporting gestational surrogacy was new and foreign to policy-makers.14 Additionally, family law has historically been slow to develop,
even in a rapidly changing technological and social climate.15
More surprising is how little results have changed, even after
more than thirty years of courts grappling with surrogacy contract
enforceability questions. Traditional surrogacy, which results in the
surrogate relinquishing a child to whom she is genetically related, is
still impermissible in many American states.16 Gestational surroga14

cy, arguably more societally palatable as it permits relinquishment
of a child by a woman whose sole role was in gestating the child,
rather than in providing any genetic material, has not received
widespread approval either.17 After a struggle spanning more than
thirty years, gestational surrogacy contracts will be recognized and
enforced in only a dozen states.18 Several states, including New Jersey and Louisiana,19 have undergone high profile battles to legislate in favor of gestational surrogacy only to see those bills fail to
become law.20 The overwhelming national trend has been to reject
the reproductive choices of women through surrogacy.
Those who reject surrogacy as a valid procreative decision
believe surrogacy is a societal evil because it commodifies and
exploits women and their reproductive capacity.21 For years, scholars and reproductive conservatives have highlighted the psychological risks to women involved in surrogacy.22 Opponents of surrogacy
argue women are likely to be exploited in the process, especially if

they are being monetarily compensated. Both scholars and legislators have warned that only women in the lowest socio-economic classes will volunteer as surrogates, because of the promise of a
hefty financial reward. Accordingly, many states have moved to ban
compensated surrogacy arrangements altogether.24 The “renting of
the womb,” then, remains impermissible in all but a dozen states.25
Even in the modern day and age, most states cannot seem
to move past objections to women being paid for playing a role in
the reproductive process. Men “get paid for their efforts, skills, and
services,” even in the reproductive context, but the view remains
that “women, being women, should do their woman-things out of
purity of heart and sentiment. Women are too delicate, too pure, to
be tainted by filthy lucre.”26
More importantly, most states continue to reject even uncompensated gestational surrogacy arrangements.27 In this context, no

financial exploitation issues arise, yet states continue to refuse to
sanction the practice. Women are too hormonal, they say, to be held
to the contracts they have formed. Women don’t know their own
minds, and simply cannot anticipate the trauma that will result from
relinquishing a child for whom they have acted as a gestational carrier. The result is a body of state law that “exalts a woman’s experience of pregnancy and childbirth over her formation of emotional,
intellectual and interpersonal decisions and expectations, as well as
over others’ reliance on the commitments she has earlier made.”28
This approach to surrogacy is troubling because it serves to
dishonor the reproductive will of two consenting adult women.
There is no evidence that women who undertake to act as gestational surrogates in the United States agree to such arrangements
in ignorance or because they are financially desperate and subject
to exploitation by the rich and greedy.29 To the contrary, the evidence shows that most gestational surrogates in this country are
white, middle-class, married, and have already given birth to and
raised at least one child.30 Refusing to honor surrogates’ contracts
sends a powerful societal message about the perceived “unpredictability of women’s intentions and decisions.”31
For intended mothers in surrogacy arrangements, the frustration of their will is even more egregious. In the gestational surrogacy
context, the intended mother may have contributed genetic material, and therefore may be the “biological” mother of the child.32 Still,
any agreement she makes under which she contracts for the right to
parent her own child would be unenforceable.33 In most states, that
unenforceability triggers the application of the rule that the surrogate—as the woman who gave birth to the child—is the child’s legal
mother.34 By refusing to recognize the intended mother’s autonowhere other contractual requisites are not met. Khiara M. Bridges, Windsor,

my, these states continue to disempower women, negatively affecting intended mothers perhaps even more so than surrogates.
Current law deprives both intended mothers and surrogates
of the freedom to make reproductive decisions. Men in similar situations (i.e., sperm donation) are not so deprived. No regulatory
controls determine the price of sperm.35 No state laws tell men they
cannot provide their gametes or services for reproductive purposes,
whether for compensation or not.36 No laws refuse to honor the
will of the men who make informed decisions to create, but not
to parent, children through gamete donation.37 And no legislatures
seem to hide behind questions surrounding the long-term impact of
gamete donation on the resulting children.38
Men are consistently empowered in the reproductive decision-making process while women are not. Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this dichotomy is that often men, and not women,
make the laws depriving women of the reproductive decision-making freedom men possess. Although there have been improvements
over the last several decades, state legislatures and the judiciary remain dominated by men.39 With less involvement in the legislative and judicial conversation, it is not surprising that female
empowerment is not a core value of the law relating to reproductive
rights. Affording men and women differing levels of control over
their procreative choices sends a startling message of female disempowerment of which all policymakers should be cognizant.

Egg Lending Absent Donative Intent: An Archaic Regime

to be implanted with those eggs themselves, as egg donors. Many
of these women, however, are not purely egg donors. They do not
give eggs to be used by a stranger. Rather, they allow the use of
their eggs in an IVF procedure performed on their female romantic partner.41 The egg contributor in these cases is both a biological and intended mother of the resulting child.42 Still, most states
would not presume the woman contributing the eggs to be the legal
mother of the child.43 Again, most states recognize only the woman
giving birth to the child as that child’s legal mother.44 The scenario
outlined above, however, cries out for an exception to the general
rule and warrants a recognition of the parental rights of the biological and intended mother. At least two states have created such an
exception.45 The vast majority, however, have not.46
One of the most significant obstacles to providing appropriate recognition of maternal rights in the aforementioned context is,
quite simply, terminology. The law has generally labeled all arrangements whereby a woman allows her eggs to be used by another
woman in reproduction as egg donation. “Colloquially speaking,”
a woman who provides eggs for reproduction, with the gestation to
be undertaken by her partner “donates” the eggs to her partner.47
“Yet such a characterization is loaded with inapplicable nuances,
which should not be determinative of parental rights. Advances in
reproductive technologies have antiquated the once-precise terminology of donor.”48 Historically, a donor of male or female gametes
for reproduction was one who provided gametes (typically anonymously) with no attendant rights to parent the resulting child.
Donors usually did not expect to or wish to parent the children
created with the aid of their gametes and, indeed, were typically
required at the time of the donation to execute writings relinquishing all parental rights in the resulting children.49

[Vol. 24.1

As one scholar has noted, “true donation” is distinct from the
“intentional lend[ing] of procreative genetic material.”50 Yet family
law continues to treat the situations as synonymous, and the consequences of the law’s failure to adequately adapt are drastic for the
egg lender. As donors, egg lenders are deemed to have irrevocably
parted with their gametes, “relinquish[ing] to the donee all present
and future dominion and control over [them].”51 In this modern egg
lending context, a genetic mother is deprived of the right to parent
her offspring, even in the face of a willingness, a competence, and
the shared intention of all parties involved for her to do so.
Furthermore, women lending eggs without donative intent is
not a rare occurrence. American families are changing rapidly, and
a multitude of states have already been faced with cases involving
almost precisely the same facts.52
States’ parentage statutes did not originate from an intent to
deny intended mothers and egg lenders parental rights. That outcome is an outgrowth of a historical relic of family law—the notion
that the only woman who can have a legal maternal connection with
a child is the woman who has given birth to the child. And while
that rule may have made sense a century ago, times have changed.53
Today, the continuation of a filiation scheme that wholly refuses to
recognize the intentional and genetic connection between a child
and an intentional egg lender is unjustifiable.
Such a set of rules treats the sexes inequitably. “Current
parentage statutes provide several means by which an intended
father can establish parentage; however, these statutes are often
gender-specific and, consequently, not equally applicable to women as a means of establishing parental rights.”54 The law regulating intentional egg lending is, by definition, sexist and disrespects
women’s reproductive decisions. The failure to honor the wishes of
two women, both intimately involved in the reproductive process,
renders their procreative choices meaningless. That result would be
troubling no matter the circumstances, but the fact that American
law generally refuses to recognize an intention-based maternal link

even for women biologically related to the child at issue crosses
into a truly disturbing realm.
Courts and legislatures alike must rethink filiative rules, recognizing that not all “egg donors” are truly donors. Acknowledging a
more nuanced possibility, given modern reproductive technologies,
would serve to empower women and to provide the much-needed
respect for the procreative decisions that the law currently lacks
altogether. It is nearly impossible to claim that children would suffer from a legal scheme that recognized their ties to a woman who
is both a genetic and intentional parent. Additionally, the societal
benefit of empowering women by affirming the worthiness of their
reproductive choices is simply inestimable.
II. Punitive Damages: Punishment Without Positivity?
Among the more popular directions of state domestic violence legislation has been a push towards making punitive damages
awardable in domestic violence cases. By both lifting the prohibition on suits between spouses and expressly providing for punitive
damages, states have simultaneously moved to both eliminate the
historical barriers to suit faced by victims of spousal abuse and to
incentivize victims of domestic violence to act. These incentives are
likely to prove effective in encouraging more domestic violence victims to sue under these more liberal procedural and substantive
statutory standards. But there is little reason to believe that such an
outcome better serves the victims of domestic violence. An increase
in litigation between the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence is likely to create substantial negative effects in terms of
female empowerment.
A.

Paving the Path Through Punitive Damage Legislation
Historically, the availability of punitive damages in the domestic violence context was a nonissue. At common law, all spouses
were prohibited from suing one another, due to the interspousal
bar to suit.55 Great concern over the propriety of judicial involvement in the business of an ongoing family unit convinced judges
and legislators alike that disputes between married persons were
best situated out of the courtroom.56 As a result, interspousal suits
were, at one time, impermissible in every state.57
Thompson v. Thompson, 218 U.S. 611, 618 (1910).
Shearer v. Shearer, 480 N.E.2d 388, 390 (Ohio 1985) (citing the general
public policy that courts should not interfere with the family as the rationale
behind intrafamily immunity, but abrogating interspousal immunity nonetheless).
57
After its recognition in America in the 1860s, interspousal immunity en55

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

[Vol. 24.1

Courts and legislatures around the country began to question
the continuing propriety of the interspousal bar to suit in the early
1920s.58 Finding the traditional public policy reasons for adhering to
the doctrine—including adherence to the legal fiction of a husband
and wife as a single person, avoiding disruption of the family, and
discouraging collusive schemes to exploit insurance policies—no
longer held, states began to abolish the doctrine entirely.59
In a 1993 decision abolishing interspousal immunity, for
instance, the Florida Supreme Court remarked that:
We [previously] held that the doctrine of interspousal
immunity no longer is applicable when the public policy reasons for applying it do not exist. Based on this
holding, we found . . . that the doctrine did not bar a
wife’s claim filed against the insurer of a deceased husband when the factual claim before us arose from the
same accident in which the husband died and when the
claim did not exceed the limits of liability. Since [that
decision] was issued, this Court and its advisory commissions have had an opportunity to review legal issues
joyed nationwide application for the next fifty years. Carl Tobias, Interspousal
Tort Immunity in America, 23 Ga. L. Rev. 359, 359 (1989).
58
Early on, some states made exceptions to immunity for violent and willful tortious acts perpetrated by husbands against their wives. See, e.g., Johnson
v. Johnson, 77 So. 335 (Ala. 1917) (allowing wife to sue her husband for assault
and battery); Fitzpatrick v. Owens, 186 S.W. 832 (Ark. 1916) (permitting wrongful death suit brought by wife against husband); Brown v. Brown, 89 A. 889
(Conn. 1914) (allowing interspousal suit for battery and false imprisonment);
Gilman v. Gilman, 95 A. 657, 657 (N.H. 1915) (interpreting Pub.St.1901, c. 176,
§ 2 to authorize suit by wife against husband for assault); Fiedler v. Fiedler, 140
P. 1022, 1025 (Okla. 1914) (reading state constitution and statutes to allow recovery to a wife for injuries maliciously and feloniously inflicted upon her by a
husband, but asserting that the right did not allow her to claim exemplary damages for mental anguish or humiliation). Other states removed the bar for negligent torts, but only in the case of automobile accidents. See Bushnell v. Bushnell, 131 A. 432 (Conn. 1925); Pardue v. Pardue, 166 S.E. 101 (S.C. 1932).

relevant to the doctrine of interspousal immunity. As a
result of that review, we now find that there no longer
is a sufficient reason warranting a continued adherence
to the doctrine of interspousal immunity. As we previously have held, the common law will not be altered
or expanded by this Court unless demanded by public
necessity or to vindicate fundamental rights. Here, we
find that both public necessity and fundamental rights
require judicial abrogation of the doctrine.60
In that case, the court acknowledged that Florida had been
“in a shrinking minority” in persisting with interspousal immunity,
as thirty-two states had already abrogated the doctrine entirely.61
Today, that minority is smaller still, with only six states continuing to recognize immunity.62 And even in those few states retaining
immunity, a myriad of exceptions to the rule essentially render it a
toothless anachronism.63
On the heels of the abrogation of interspousal immunity
came the subsequent creation of a cause of action for “continuing
domestic violence,” a statutory tort legitimizing the claims of the
victims of domestic violence and solving the limitation problems

that frequently plagued their claims. With the bar to suit lifted,
an express recognition of their right to sue, and a distinct statutory
basis for recovery, domestic violence victims finally had the potential to hold their abusers accountable in tort, a development recognized as long in the making and highly desirable.65
Along with the extension of private tort claims to the victims of domestic violence, however, a more questionable trend
has emerged. Victims are statutorily entitled to compensatory
awards, injunctions, costs, and even attorneys fees; but now courts
are increasingly granting these in conjunction with a form of damages not previously contemplated in the domestic violence context: punitives.66

proximately causing; (5) physical injury or emotional distress.” Id. at 1068. See

Of course, tort litigants are no strangers to punitive damages.
For more than two hundred years, courts have awarded them as an
aid to accomplishing the goals of tort litigation.67 Punitive damages
incentivize bringing claims that may otherwise be deemed unworthy of litigation given the relatively low reward of a pure loss-based
recovery, and they offer rewards to plaintiffs for the public service
of bringing a wrongdoer to justice.68 But most importantly, they punish tortfeasors in the hopes of deterring abhorrent conduct.69 Many
torts scholars have lauded the effectiveness of punitive damages.70
And strong evidence indicates that they generally accomplish their
objectives.71 Punitive damages provide a powerful incentive against
juries sustained when her boyfriend broke her arm); Henriksen v. Cameron, 622
A.2d at 1138, 1144 (Me. 1993) (awarding $75,000 in compensatory damages and
$40,000 in punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress);

2013) (affirming trial court’s award of $500,000 in punitive damages on tort
claim joined with a divorce action, but asserting abuse of discretion in levying
attorneys costs and fees related to the divorce action).
67
Punitive damages were awarded in the United States as early as 1784.
Genay v. Norris, 1 S.C.L. (1 Bay) 6, 6 (1784). While punitive damages were a
rarity in early American judicial decisions, the mid- to late-1900s witnessed a
noted spike in their frequency in civil suits. A 2005 report issued by the Department of Justice found that 12 percent of all plaintiffs bringing civil suit in state
courts sought punitive damages, and 30 percent of those requests were granted.

behavior are few and ineffective.”72
It is thus unsurprising that the state-law movement toward
enhancing protections for the victims of domestic violence would
capitalize on tort law’s punitive damage concept. Even Congress,
in passing the 2000 version of the Violence Against Women Act,
extended the possibility of a punitive damage recovery to the victims of “crimes of violence motivated by gender.”73 And while the
Supreme Court held this version of VAWA unconstitutional in 2000
as violative of the Commerce Clause,74 states began to follow suit.
California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and North Dakota
have all made the right of a victim of domestic violence to recover
punitive damages in a suit against her attacker express by statute.75
The list of states acting similarly continues to grow, with Louisiana
joining the list in 2014. This demonstrates an unmistakable trend in

gender; and [. . .] the term ‘crime of violence’ means—(A) an act or series of

here is to enable domestic violence victims to capitalize on the benefits of punitive damages as a tool in bringing suit and obtaining
financial independence from their attackers.78
It is difficult to disagree with this approach, particularly given the hope it appears to offer domestic violence victims. If punitives have succeeded in tort in general, why can they not succeed in
this context?
B.

Potholes Along the Path—the Inability of Punitives to Make
Real Strides Toward Solving the Domestic Violence Problem
Punitives theoretically provide a means of empowering victims of domestic violence by providing them with cash at a time in
which they are arguably most desperate. To the extent the availability of punitive damage recoveries incentivize victims to escape their
attackers, it is difficult to quibble with their availability. The trouble
is that punitive damages are ill-equipped to live up to their promise
in the domestic violence context. They may, indeed, incentivize litigation brought on behalf of the domestic violence victims, but they
do so at a great price. Further, from a pragmatic perspective, both
the timing of the recovery of punitives through the litigation process, and the relatively unsympathetic view of juries in this domain,
make punitives an ineffective tool to address domestic violence.

Indeed, that incentive is the very reason victims’ advocates have
pressed state legislatures so vigorously to allow for punitives in the
domestic abuse context.80 Litigant concerns about the relative costs
and benefits of the trial process are substantially assuaged when
punitive damages are a possibility.81 A once risky cause of action,
with high cost potential, but likely minimal reward—given the limited nature of compensatories, even considering emotional distress
damages—is likely a significant deterrent to filing suit for domestic violence victims.82 The financial and emotional toll of the litigation simply is not often offset by the potential return.83 As a result,
the perpetrators of domestic violence almost never face civil legal
action addressed toward compensating the victims of the injuries
they caused.84
The availability of punitives changes the calculus substantially. The increased reward possibility provides helpful motivation to
pursue a private cause of action against an abuser.85 And the victims of domestic violence are not the only persons incentivized.
Lawyers, who may have shied away from such cases for the similar
financial and emotional reasons as their clients, are far more likely to
agree to representation of victims, particularly on a contingent-fee

basis, with the hope of a punitive damage recovery looming.86 Punitive damages have encouraged litigation in other areas of the law
and hopefully will encourage litigation in the domestic violence
context.87 In short, if the goal of legislators and victims’ rights advocates is to incentivize filing civil suits against batterers, allowing the
recovery of punitive damages is effective insofar as it increases both
litigant and lawyer incentives to file suit.88
However, while an increase in tort actions would target
perpetrators of domestic violence, a simultaneous boost in victim independence and empowerment remains unlikely. First, the
punitive damage incentive typically fails to live up to its promise
when domestic violence cases actually come before juries. Juries
award punitive damages more frequently than do judges,89 and
juries rarely get the opportunity to weigh in on damages in today’s
settlement-heavy litigation practice.90 But even when they do take
up cases of domestic violence, juries are largely unsympathetic to

victims’ prayers for punitive damages. Juries often have a difficult time contextualizing behavior by domestic violence victims
that appears “maladaptive, illogical, and unstable” as they are often
unaware of the unique dynamics of an abusive relationship and its
psychological effect on the victim.92
Second, a tort claim against a batterer may be financially
beneficial, but remains exceptionally physically and emotionally
dangerous for domestic violence victims, regardless of the outcome
of the case.93 The litigation process is neither quick nor simple,94
and incentives to pursue domestic violence litigation must be balanced with the reality that the litigation ties the victim and attacker
together for years.95 Litigation thereby undermines victims’ critical need for financial independence and a clean break from their
attackers, as does the collection of the judgment itself. Even when

Women who are divorced or separated are at higher risk of assault than

Furthermore, studies in Philadelphia and Chicago revealed that twenty-five percent of women murdered by their male partners were separated or divorced from their assailants. Another twenty-nine percent

a victim succeeds in winning a hefty award of punitives, the collection process is often lengthy and fraught with substantial animosity
flowing from the tortfeasor.96
This article does not suggest that states return to the archaic
theory of interspousal immunity, that tort suits should not be permissible to address domestic violence, or even that states should
refrain from providing punitive damages to the victims of domestic
violence. From an equitable perspective, victims of domestic violence should have, at a minimum, the right to pursue those claims
just as battered strangers would against their attackers. The article
does argue, however, that special consideration should be given to
the real-world effects of expressly providing for punitives in domestic violence cases. A typical tort victim does not suffer from the
same shame and fear of physical reprisal as a domestic violence victim when considering litigation. A typical tort victim is not engaged
in a struggle to gain financial independence from the tortfeasor. A
typical tort victim does not need to be assured of little to no future
contact with the tortfeasor. And a typical tort victim does not need
the law to empower her in the way a battered woman does.
Punitives punish.97 Punitives deter.98 And while they can
punish and deter perpetrators equally effectively in the domestic
violence context as they can in the stranger tortfeasor context, the
effect of litigation on victims is not analogous between these contexts. Legislators, judges, and academics alike must recognize the
special placement and special needs of domestic violence victims in
the litigation sphere. Such recognition necessitates a reflection on
the reality that providing for punitives for domestic violence victims fails, in many respects, to empower women. In fact, the potential for further harm and victimization looms. Legislators’ time and
efforts spent curbing the domestic violence crisis may be better
spent rejecting special punitive damage-related statutes. Legislators should instead search for other ways to help victims achieve
independence that serve to empower them as they move forward in
separating from their attackers.

III. Spousal Support: Furthering “Habituation to Dependency”?
Among the more controversial issues facing family law over
the course of the last two decades has been the desirability of a continued scheme of permanent, or long-term, spousal support.99 Even
outside the domestic violence context, spousal support schemes
have become a lightning rod of controversy.100 By no means has a
national consensus developed.101 And over the course of the last
several years, this problem has emerged in the domestic violence
arena. As state legislatures have shown an increasing willingness
to use spousal support as a tool in addressing the needs of domestic violence victims, the ties between a troubled spousal support
scheme and aid for domestic violence victims have become concerning. Little thought appears to have been given to the propriety of addressing the financial effects of domestic violence through
spousal support, particularly in light of its significant effect—to perpetuate a tie between victim and attacker.
A.

The State of Spousal Support
Alimony schemes did not always suffer the disparagement
they do today.102 Indeed, until the late 1990s, alimony was a relatively well-accepted, and typical, consequence of divorce.103 That view
was easily cultivated because, historically, the purpose of alimony
was clear. It was “paid only by guilty husbands to innocent wives,”
and essentially acted as “a form of damages: the financial penalty
the law imposed upon husbands as a result of their wrongful conduct
in breaching the permanency clause of the marriage contract. . . .”104
Of course, spousal support today is a reciprocal obligation,105 but

still larger changes have occurred in the theoretical underpinnings
of the alimony scheme.
With the advent of nationwide no-fault divorce, husbands
need not be proven to have engaged in any wrongful conduct to
pursue a divorce action or to be saddled with a judgment requiring the payment of alimony.106 Indeed, it is not necessary to assign
blame to either spouse in modern no-fault divorce.107 With no culpable spouse, the “punishment” purpose for spousal support no longer exists.108 This fundamental change has shaken the foundation
of the spousal support system.109 Many have suggested eliminating
the entire spousal support scheme in the wake of universal no-fault
divorce.110 It has nonetheless persisted, with states struggling to
develop a justification for its continued existence.111
The most entrenched modern defense of spousal support
regimes is that they can potentially rectify financial imbalances that
frequently result from the dissolution of a marriage.112 The underlying assumption is that “when a marriage is dissolved, there are
usually losses associated with it, such as lost employment opportunities, or opportunities to acquire education or training, which lead
to disparities in post-divorce earning capacities.”113 Even today,
women suffer more financially in after divorce than do their male
counterparts.114 When marriage has lulled one spouse into a “habituation to dependency,” states have used spousal support as the

solution. Thus, the original punishment motive has largely given
way to a more need-based, disparity-focused approach.116 However,
that shift is by no means universal. Perhaps the most difficult task
facing the legislators and scholars grappling with this issue today is
defending its continued justification in a changing legal, economic,
and social climate.117
In the domestic violence context, the failure of family law
to clearly answer that question has been decidedly problematic.
Female victims of domestic violence, in particular, suffer a great
deal. From a financial perspective alone, “[s]urviving abuse pushes women into poverty due to health complications, homelessness,
and unemployment. In [one year alone,] the Centers for Disease
Control estimated that victims of intimate partner violence in the
United States lost almost 8 million days of work. Reductions in
days worked generally lead to reductions in pay, leaving victims
even more stressed about their life options.”118 In short, “economic
dependence may be the single most important reason why women
stay” with an abuser.119
State legislators have not ignored the needs of domestic violence victims. With limited options, they have generally settled on
spousal support as the primary means of financially aiding victims.
Indeed, spousal support has been described as “the only available
tool for addressing cases” in which economic disparity persists at
divorce, particularly when this economic disparity is tied to family violence.120
The manner in which states have tied spousal support and
domestic violence has varied, but has typically proceeded along
three themes. First, a state may expressly authorize the payment
of spousal support in conjunction with the issuance of a protective
order for domestic violence.121 More than thirty-five states have

sanctioned this form of emergency relief. These states recognize
the need of domestic violence victims to receive financial assistance
with as little contact with their attackers as possible.122 For example,
several states authorize wage withholding for the payment of emergency support awards in domestic violence cases in order to limit
the contact between the victim and the abuser.123 Emergency support issued in connection with a protective order, however, is just
that—emergency support.124 It is typically short-term, and intended
solely to get the recipient through the difficult period immediately following separation from her attacker.125 Most state legislation

At least five states make domestic abuse a factor that courts are
required to consider when determining whether to award permanent spousal support.127 This evolution in the law has not been
without controversy. When alimony’s well-accepted purpose was to
punish a wrongdoing spouse, consideration of marital fault—and
particularly domestic violence—was appropriate.128 However, the
relevance of marital fault in a more need-based, economic-dependence-focused era of spousal support is questionable at best.129
Some scholars and victims’ advocates have attempted to avoid this
difficulty by emphasizing how domestic violence generally goes
hand-in-hand with an atmosphere of control.130 Domestic violence
victims are more likely to be economically dependent on others
than their non-abused, but otherwise similarly situated, counterparts.131 It may well be true that domestic violence is relevant to the

permanent spousal support determination insofar as it is likely to
bolster or provide a reason for the claimant’s need. But by making
marital fault (and thereby domestic violence) a factor courts must
consider in determining the propriety and amount of a permanent
spousal support award, state legislatures have effectively sanctioned its consideration in all cases. Even financially independent
victims of spousal support are entitled to a consideration of marital
fault, bringing the archaic punishment purpose of spousal support
back to the forefront.
One argument justifying this development relies on the needbased limitation of modern spousal support.132 For example, even
if a court ordered a large spousal support award after due consideration of domestic violence throughout the course of a marriage,
state law would prevent the court from doing so if the victim was
not financially needy.133 Moreover, marital fault is just one factor
in a complicated spousal support analysis. Therefore, the consideration of domestic violence as a factor in the spousal support evaluation does not necessarily mean that permanent support will be
ordered.134 Still, the mandatory domestic violence factor in a perwelfare reliant as those who never experienced domestic violence.”).

manent spousal support determination hearkens back to the days in
which spouses—typically husbands—were ordered to pay hefty and
permanent alimony as a punishment for their marital misdeeds.135
In attempting to aid the victims of domestic violence, many state
legislatures, perhaps unwittingly, have revived that historical, punishment-focused rationale for spousal support.
Generally, such a course of action is somewhat troubling if not
reconciled with the broader themes of permanent spousal support
and its purpose. But one state has taken an even more aggressive,
more disturbing, third approach. In 2014, Louisiana became the
first state to mandate an award of permanent spousal support for
domestic violence victims.136 Louisiana’s statute provides that:
When a spouse has not been at fault prior to the filing of a petition for divorce and the court determines
that party was the victim of domestic abuse committed
during the marriage by the other party, that spouse shall
be awarded final periodic support or a lump sum award,
at the discretion of the court, in accordance with Paragraph C of this Article.137
This statute became law as part of a package of legislation
designed to make a concrete effort at addressing Louisiana’s domestic violence crisis.138 The package included the creation (for the first
time in Louisiana) of an immediate, fault-based ground for divorce
for abuse, an express approval of punitive damages for domestic
violence victims, and protective order procedure modifications.
These provisions are all tailored to aid the victims of domestic violence in separating from their attackers.139
The statute, originally conceived of by a victims’ rights arm
of United Way,140 suffers from some relatively obvious, and in some
cases severe, drafting problems. Yet, in a move uncharacteristic in

the Louisiana legislature, no one spoke to oppose or otherwise critique the draft.141 It passed into law with widespread support and
little criticism, constructive or otherwise.142
In the aftermath of its adoption, the legal community in Louisiana is struggling to make sense of a severely flawed statute.143
Questions have arisen, for instance, about the extent to which need
must still be proved.144 First, did the legislature intend a mandatory support award, even in cases in which the claimant spouse does
not suffer from an economic dependency sufficient to render her
“needy”? Drafting ambiguities have made the answer to that question unclear. Second, perhaps more significantly, to what does the
“at the discretion of the court” language refer?145 Is a court required
under this statute to render an award of permanent spousal support
in all domestic violence cases, with its only discretion as to whether
to award the support as a lump sum or in installments? Or is the “at
the discretion of the court” language intended to make the entire
provision precatory? This intent would clearly conflict with the
plain language “shall,” which seems to require an order of support.
The legislation is so new that these questions of interpretation have not yet worked their way through the judicial system.146
States desiring to adopt a mandatory scheme of spousal support for
domestic violence victims would do well to pay close attention and
learn from Louisiana’s mistakes.

Drafting inadequacies are not, however, the most significant

of domestic violence to seek permanent spousal support links them
to their attackers and to further undermine their self-worth.
Much like domestic violence-related punitive damage provisions, the fundamental problem with mandatory spousal support awards, or even with using domestic violence as a factor in
the spousal support determination at all, is that such measures
incentivize women to seek support. Indeed, that is precisely what
these state statutes are designed to do. More victims of domestic
violence should be incentivized to leave their attackers. And more
victims of domestic violence should be financially aided in making
that decision in light of state statutes providing, with near certainty,
their right to spousal support. The short term success of this form
of legislation is promising. But in the long term, the likely effects
of tying together spousal support and domestic violence are much
more troubling.
The most significant problem with linking domestic violence
and spousal support is that, despite the beginnings of a shift in family law, spousal support remains largely permanent.147 Short-term,
rehabilitative support is trendy, and most states now permit judges to order it.148 But it is most certainly not the default scheme.149
We remain wed to a system of spousal support whereby a one-time
marriage generally obligates the payor to compensate the claimant
perpetually, or at least until death or the claimant’s remarriage.150
In Virginia, for instance, spousal support “must be permanent [. . .];
limited duration support is error as a matter of law.”151 Spousal support thus remains a largely permanent arrangement.

That permanence is controversial enough when analyzed in
a vacuum. When considered in the domestic violence context, its
problems become even more stark. Much like punitive damages,
permanent spousal support ties victims and attackers together on
an ongoing basis. States have taken steps to allow for the payment
of spousal support awards in a manner that does not reveal the victim’s address to the attacker.152 But even these protective measures
cannot diminish the consequent tie of victim and attacker in the
permanent support context.153 Even under a mandatory spousal
support scheme, like Louisiana’s, the amount of the support award
must be based on a consideration of the claimant’s need, the circumstances surrounding her living situation, details of her employment, and other intimate personal matters.154 Moreover, that inquiry is not a one-time occurrence. Rather, because spousal support
awards are generally permanent, they must be modified over time.
Modifications require repeated inquiries into the victim’s current
living situation.155 In the wake of an award of permanent spouA.B.A. (Apr. 2012), (http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/april_2012/current_trends_alimony_law.html; (discussing Va. Code

sal support in the domestic violence context, the attacker spouse
would have a right to inquire into details surrounding the victim’s
continuing living situation.156 Because most states have adopted a
“live-in lover” rule terminating spousal support when the recipient
lives in a meretricious relationship with another,157 the attacker will
have the legal right to dig into the claimant’s sexual activity for
years to come.158 He may inject himself, through the use of the litigation process, into her financial and employment affairs, and into
any other sphere bearing on need.159 While the attacker’s ability to
manipulate the litigation process is limited by statutes addressing
frivolous or harassing claims, these limits are likely to be of little
comfort to a recovering victim of domestic violence.160
Even absent any nefarious motive, in the best of circumstances, permanent spousal support awarded to a victim of domestic violence ties her to her attacker perpetually. Such an outcome
undermines the very purpose of domestic violence victims’ legislation—to provide these women with the financial means for making
a clean break from their attackers.
Moreover, permanent financial support for the victims of
domestic violence—particularly when mandated—undermines
the very independence and empowerment these women strive to
achieve and so desperately need. One of the most documented and
severe harms of domestic violence is its subjugation of the victim to
the attacker.161 Often, through abusive control, the victim is cabined
into an inferior relationship role, and made to feel worthless and
to note that a court reviewing a previous award of maintenance must not solely
limit its inquiry to the support objective. The objective of fairness also must be
considered, even in postdivorce proceedings.”).

dependent. Permanent spousal support only serves to reinforce
those negative feelings. It relies on a public statement—through a
judicial officer—that the recipient is unable to provide for her own
support and, in fact, is dependent on others.163 That message is troubling enough, but spousal support legislation goes a step further,
deeming the victim incapable of self-support. Only one person is,
thereafter, charged with the duty to help—the former spouse/attacker. Permanent spousal support awards in the domestic violence context simply serve to underscore the messages of dependence and
lack of empowerment already looming large in the domestic violence context.
Of course, this article does not suggest that victims of domestic violence should be unable to recover spousal support, or that
they should be subject to temporal limitations on support that do
not govern other spousal support claimants. Rather, it calls for state
legislators and scholars to step back and think critically about the
effect of spousal support rules in this particular context. As women
who have suffered from the inability to attain independence and
control over their own circumstances, victims of domestic violence
arguably need empowering more than others. Lawmakers should
tailor domestic violence-related legislation, as it relates to family
law, in a way that achieves empowerment for victims. Simply plugging the victims of domestic violence into an existing spousal support framework, given its indefinitely continuing nature, perhaps
should be rejected. Other financial means of incentivizing women
to leave their attackers, which do not simultaneously tie the victim
and attacker together perpetually, must also be explored. In other
words, domestic violence victims are long overdue a careful consideration of all economic mechanisms states may be able to employ
best to empower them.164

IV. Marital Property: Labor Contributions
Over Human Capital
Long recognized as an area of family law in which great
strides in women’s rights have been made,165 one might expect
marital property, in the entire scheme of family law, to be rather
advanced in terms of female empowerment. Indeed, the very genesis of the community property regime—still the prevailing property
regime in nine American states166— was an attempt to recognize a
by awarding a greater portion of the marital estate to the victim of domestic violence. See, e.g., DeSilva v. DeSilva, No. 350818/05, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 2489,

woman’s contributions to marriage as equal to, and worthy of the
same recognition, as her husband’s.167 Centuries after the creation
of the community property regime, however, it still fails to live up
to that promise. Moreover, separate property regimes in the other forty-one states do even worse. Marital property regimes fail to
empower the women they intended to aid both by failing to truly recognize human capital as a marital asset, and by persisting in
equitable division of property.
A.

Ignoring Human Capital
Both community and separate property regimes alike treat
the results of a spouse’s labor in the marketplace as divisible marital property.168 When both spouses work outside the home and
earn in parity with one another, marital property regimes benefit
the spouses equally.169 The current reality, however, is that women
do not work outside the home as frequently as men.170 And even
when they do choose these roles, they are undercompensated as
compared to their male counterparts.171 The unwillingness of modWilliam Q. de Funiak & Michael J. Vaughn, Principles of Community

ern marital property regimes to treat spouses’ human capital as a
marital asset exacerbates this problem.
Complicating the issue is that married couples make long-term
economic decisions and plans jointly.172 “These decisions shape not
only wealth and debt acquisitions, but also predictably affect earning power at divorce and for a period of years afterwards.”173 Neither
spousal support nor property distribution schemes are equipped to
handle the long-term effects of these decisions adequately.174 As a
result, gender inequality is further perpetuated “as husbands tend
to realize the advantages and wives tend to bear the disadvantages
produced at least in part by a collaborative economy.”175
At the heart of the inequity is the failure of marital property
law to recognize, and mandate sharing, of the human resources of
marriage. Perhaps the most striking example is the refusal of all
but two states to treat professional degrees and licenses as marital
property.176 Insurance is, likewise, not generally considered marital
property to be shared between the spouses.177 And states almost
universally fail to recognize earning capacity as a divisible asset.178
For many couples, however, these are the only things of value a couple owns at the dissolution of the marriage.179 Nearly without fail, it
is women, and not men, who are prejudiced by the law’s failure to
recognize these important human resources.180

Equitable, Not Equal, Division
Similarly troubling is the predilection in American marital
property law to distribute property among spouses equitably rather
than equally. Indeed, thirty-four states have adopted an equitable
division scheme.181 “The result, according to a number of studies, is
that husbands end up with a majority of marital property as well as
with greater earning potential.”182
Ironically, equitable distribution schemes were developed
to help women. Equitable distribution was proposed to “promote
a sense of fairness in the treatment of women upon divorce” by
accounting for both financial and more personal contributions to
the family.183 But multiple studies have shown that the realities of
the gender wage gap and the refusal of marital property law to
adequately value human capital as a marital asset actually “result
in a bias towards women, rather than benefitting them.”184 The discretionary nature of equitable distribution schemes simply allows
judges the leeway to enforce a body of marital property law that

Family Law and Female Empowerment

results in women bearing more of the financial losses of a couple’s
joint decision-making than is equitable.185
Far from empowering women, modern marital property law
does the opposite. What began as a system designed to serve the
interests of women has become—largely through an overly narrow
conception of shared property and an unwavering adherence to
equitable distribution—just another mechanism of “reinforce[ing]
men’s control within the family before and after the divorce.”186
V. Conclusion
Feminists have a significant opportunity in this fourth wave
to make great strides for female empowerment. Feminists in family
law, in particular, must take a close look at the doctrines of their
field and take the difficult and necessary steps to improve them
where inequality persists.
Inequalities persist in honoring female reproductive choices. Wholly failing to respect the decision-making of women in this
arena substantially undermines the empowerment tenet of modern feminism. Treatment of all women relinquishing eggs as stranger-“donors” simply exacerbates the message that women are entitled to little respect when it comes to their bodies and their children.
When it comes to money, however, modern family law treats
women even worse. Legislatures purport to give women a boon in
allowing them punitive damages and increased spousal support in
the domestic violence context. But these “remedies” are both illusory and damaging in the real world. Where the law could easily
honor women’s contributions to the family in a financially rewarding manner—namely, in marital property—it simply fails to do so.
The result is a body of family law far afield of feminist ideals.
Indeed, there is much work to do.
