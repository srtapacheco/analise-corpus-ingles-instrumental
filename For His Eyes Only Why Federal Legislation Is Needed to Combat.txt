“FOR HIS EYES ONLY”:

Why Federal Legislation Is Needed To Combat
Revenge Porn

Erica Souza*
Introduction
He told her the pictures would be for his eyes only.1 He promised they would be hidden away on a compact disc.2 So Annmarie
Chiarini, after relentless coaxing, agreed to send nude photographs
of herself to her long-distance boyfriend, Joey.3
Annmarie’s ordeal began when they broke up in 2010.4 Joey
promised to “destroy” her.5 He put the disc containing Annmarie’s
photos up for auction on eBay under the listing “English Professor
Nude Photos!” and forwarded the link to Annmarie’s friends and
acquaintances.6
Consumed by humiliation, Annmarie oscillated “between
panic and persistent anxiety.”7 She would often wake up at 3:00 AM

to check her email and run a Google search of her name before
being able to settle down.8 Though the e-Bay auction had been
removed, her torment was not over.9 During one night of frantic
searching, Annmarie found a pornographic website with a profile
claiming to be hers.10 It featured the photos from Joey’s disc, as well
as her full name, the city where she lived, the name of the college
where she taught, and a solicitation for sex.11 The profile was only 14
days old, but it had already been viewed over 3,000 times.12 Annmarie later learned that copies of the original disc were mailed to her
boss and to her son’s kindergarten teacher.13
Damage control ate up Annmarie’s time. She reported Joey
for abuse on several websites and brought online printouts to a
local police precinct.14 The officers merely snickered and explained
that there was nothing they could do as no crime had been committed.15 According to Annmarie, “It drove my shame and embarrassment to a paralyzing level.”16 She feared for her safety.17 Following
her therapist’s advice, Annmarie requested leave from work, but
her employer denied her request under the rationale that she “perpetrated the incident” herself.18 She again contacted the police, but
received the same response: because she originally posed for and
sent the photographs voluntarily, it was technically legal in the state
where Annmarie lived for someone else to post those photographs,
even without her consent.19
Nonconsensual pornography, commonly referred to as
“revenge porn,” is defined as the distribution of sexually graphic
images of individuals “without consent or for no legitimate purpose.”20 Often these intimate photos or videos are originally created
or obtained with the consent of the subject within the confines of an
intimate relationship.21 Images need not to have been posted by “a

simply by circulating an explicit image of a person without his or
her consent.24
Nonconsensual pornography causes dramatic and, in some
cases, irreversible harm to the victim.25 Beyond the obvious embarrassment suffered,26 victims are often threatened with bodily harm,27
fired from their jobs,28 or forced to change their names.29 Some have
been driven to suicide.30

held accountable for their actions and victims are rarely remedied.33
“In the real world, civil lawsuits are no remedy at all,” says Mitchell
Matorin, an attorney who has represented revenge porn victims.34
Civil litigation is costly,35 and even if a lawyer is willing to take on a
case,36 the harms inflicted on revenge porn victims often do not fit
nicely into existing legal theories of remediable injury.37 To address
this problem, twenty-seven states have enacted laws that criminalize the distribution of nonconsensual pornography.38 However,
these state laws vary in scope,39 and they often contain loopholes,
such as prohibiting prosecution when the images originated as “selfies,”40 or requiring a specific motive of the perpetrator.41 This leaves
too many victims without a remedy.
One state, Illinois, has crafted a law that addresses these failings. The Non-Consensual Dissemination of Private Sexual Images
statute in the Illinois Criminal Code allows a revenge porn victim

to recover damages no matter the origin of the images, and requires
only an intent to disseminate the image rather than an intent to
cause harm.42
This Article argues that lawmakers should adopt a federal
criminal statute modeled after Illinois’ in order to prevent perpetrators of revenge porn from slipping through the cracks of inadequate state law.43 Part II describes how revenge porn has become
a widespread problem within the United States, explaining why it
should legally be considered a form of sexual abuse and addressing common misconceptions regarding consent in the context of
personal-information sharing. Part III discusses the current lack of
legal remedies available to revenge porn victims, and finally, Part IV
proposes a comprehensive amendment to the United States Code
aimed at closing common loopholes in revenge porn laws and providing victims with the recognition and remedies they deserve.
I. Revenge Porn Is Sexual Abuse
A.

A Brief History of Revenge Porn
Though nonconsensual pornography may seem like a 21st
century problem, it first arose as a legal issue in the 1980s. In February of 1980, a Texas couple, LaJuan and Billy Wood, were shocked
to discover that LaJuan’s nude image appeared in the latest issue
of Hustler Magazine.44 At that time, Hustler Magazine published a
monthly column with photos submitted by readers of themselves.45
The couple recognized the image as one they had taken together,
but they insisted they never submitted it to Hustler.46 In fact, the
photograph had been stolen from their bedroom drawer by a neighbor who mailed it to the magazine along with a forged consent
form.47 Hustler published the photo along with information about
LaJuan, some of which was true, such as her name and her hobby
of collecting arrowheads; some of it false and inflammatory, such as
her age, address, and fantasy of being “tied down and screwed by
two bikers.”48 As a result, LaJuan suffered severe mental anguish
requiring psychological treatment for six weeks.49

Since then, technology has made it vastly easier to distribute explicit images of people without their consent. A 2013 study
conducted by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative found that over 60
percent of the 1606 total respondents had shared intimate photos
or videos of themselves with another,50 and 23 percent had been victims of revenge porn.51 The same study also found that women were
the victims in roughly 90 percent of revenge porn cases,52 and over
80 percent of revenge porn victims had taken the original photo or
video themselves.53
B.

Vehicles for Revenge
Despite the dispute over the wisdom of adults taking and
sending a nude “selfie,”54 this behavior is both legal and very common.55 Certainly many individuals understand the risks as the
media thrives on exposing celebrities56 and politicians57 who take
and send nude photos or videos. Ironically, however, the media also
promotes sending photos as a “fun, easy and usually harmless way
to spice up” a couple’s love life.58 Therefore, because of the social
acceptability of sending such images59 coupled with the wealth
of technology to facilitate such conduct,60 any law criminalizing
revenge porn must include selfies.

“For His Eyes Only”

107

Revenge porn can also originate as an image taken of the victim by another person. Typically, these images are created consensually within the confines of an intimate relationship.61 It is often
the scorned ex-lover who posts these images without the victim’s
consent, as happened to Annmarie.62 However, as LaJuan’s experience demonstrates, the perpetrator may be a thief or a hacker rather than the victim’s intimate partner.
In addition to the nonconsensual dissemination of explicit
images, the dissemination of personal information in connection
with such images, known as “doxxing,” can be even more harmful.63
More than half of all nonconsensual images posted on the Internet
are accompanied by victims’ names.64 The harm caused by posting
personal identifying information alongside revenge porn can be
enormous.65 Perpetrators have even gone as far as to divulge victims’ social security numbers.66 When coupled with the nonconsensual dissemination of a pornographic image, doxxing is a potent
weapon for perpetrators, as it makes the images easier to find and
easier to attribute to the victim.67
An especially pernicious feature of revenge porn is a process
known as “downstream distribution,” or the re-posting of images
on the Internet by third parties who are not the original poster.68
While the initial revenge porn post may eventually be removed,
the offending image can be re-posted by others who captured it
before its removal, making it virtually impossible for a victim to
completely eradicate the images from the Internet once and for all.

This is why a single revenge porn post can result in a victim living in
perpetual fear, changing her name, and getting fired from her job.69
C.

Revenge Porn as Sexual Abuse
The primary issue underlying revenge porn is consent. While
voluntarily sharing a photograph or video with another person is
by definition consensual, this sharing is often done with an implied
or expressed understanding that it will remain private between the
parties.70 After all, research published by the tech company, McAfee,
in 2013 shows that 94 percent of Americans trust that their intimate
data and photographs are “safe in the hands of their partners.”71
Nevertheless, perpetrators continue to disseminate these images
even if they were received in the context of an intimate relationship.
Criminalizing the dissemination of revenge porn would encourage
society to acknowledge that posting a sexually explicit image of an
individual without her consent amounts to sexual abuse.72
Though nonconsensual pornography does not involve physical contact between victim and perpetrator, the harm to the violated party can be as severe as that inflicted upon victims of physical
sexual abuse.73 As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray wrote
in 1891, “The inviolability of the person is as much invaded by a
compulsory stripping and exposure as by a blow. To compel any
one . . . to lay bare the body, or to submit it to the touch of a stranger, without lawful authority, is an indignity, an assault, and a trespass. . . .”74 Some members of the international community have
endorsed definitions of sexual violence that do not require physical
contact. In Prosecutor v. Akayesu, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda noted that “[s]exual violence is not limited to
physical invasion of the human body and may include acts which
do not involve penetration or even physical contact.”75 Additionally,
in Prosecutor v. Furundžija, the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia recognized “all serious abuses of a sexual

nature inflicted upon the physical and moral integrity of a person
by means of coercion, threat of force or intimidation in a way that is
degrading and humiliating for the victim’s dignity.”76 Revenge porn,
though not a physical act, is a forced sexual indignity and should
therefore qualify as a form of sexual abuse.
Further, the condemnation of child pornography, both legal
and societal, illustrates that sexual images can be harmful to an
individual and qualifies as a form of sexual abuse.77 In New York v.
Ferber, the Supreme Court noted that the distribution of child pornography is “intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children,”
adding that perhaps “the only practical method of law enforcement
may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe
criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.”78 Though child pornography and revenge porn
are not equivalent, in both cases it is the lack of consent and the
harm suffered by victims—which is not necessarily connected to
any abusive physical contact—that renders their distribution repellent to society.
Some argue against criminalizing revenge porn on the grounds
that consent to share an image translates to consent in other contexts.79 According to this argument, once an individual sends an
image of herself to another or allows another to photograph her, the
keeper of that photograph may do with it what he will.80 Individuals
who share an intimate photo, critics contend, do so “in the knowledge
that it may one day end up online.”81
However, it is crucial to distinguish between isolated acts
of consent or omissions thereof. The consent to create and send a
photo or the consent to be photographed by another is one act of
consent that cannot be equated with consenting to distribute that

photo to others outside of the private relationship, because those
who consent to be photographed or send a photograph typically do
so with a reasonable expectation of privacy.83
While the U.S. Supreme Court has suggested that an individual forfeits an expectation of privacy for information voluntarily
disclosed to a third party,84 this doctrine has been questioned by
courts in contexts in which individuals may still have reasonably
expected the information to remain private with respect to third
parties.85 Regarding the Third Party Doctrine, Justice Sotomayor
wrote in her concurring opinion in United States v. Jones that:
[I]t may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an
individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in
information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This
approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people
reveal a great deal of information about themselves to
third parties.86
Justice Sotomayor suggests that certain information deserves
privacy protection even if it has been voluntarily shared with another individual. With respect to nonconsensual pornography, the
Third Party Doctrine should not apply. Rather, the law should focus
objectively on the extent of public dissemination that a reasonable
person should have expected to follow from the consensual disclosure.87 Thus, the act of sharing an intimate image that carries a reasonable expectation of confidentiality should not result in a waiver
of all privacy expectations once the image is in another’s possession.

However, current laws fail to offer recourse for violations of such
privacy when they limit recovery for revenge porn victims.
II. Current Laws Fail to Adequately Address the Problem
Although some states have recently made efforts to address
the issue of nonconsensual pornography, these attempts fail to offer
justice for all victims. As a result of time and monetary constraints,
it is impossible or impractical for the majority of revenge porn victims to pursue civil remedies.88 Seeking justice in the criminal system in also fraught with challenges. Current state efforts to criminalize revenge porn have been largely ineffective, either because
they are too wide-sweeping, calling into question their constitutionality; or because they are narrow and loophole-filled, denying a
remedy to too many victims.89 In this section, I explore the challenges of creating appropriate civil and criminal penalties, and argue
that, in their current state, these laws do little to remedy victims or
dissuade perpetrators.
A.

Civil Remedies Are Impractical
Many of those opposed to criminalizing revenge porn argue
that existing civil remedies can provide sufficient redress for victims.90 Unfortunately, this is not accurate. Whether based on theories of tort or copyright, civil suits offer only a “modest deterrence
and remedy,”91 and are often never pursued by possible plaintiffs
for practical reasons.92
1.

Tort
In theory, tort law seems to offer potentially adequate remedies to victims of revenge porn. Victims can bring suit under a theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the
perpetrator if they can prove severe emotional suffering intentionally or recklessly caused by the perpetrator’s outrageous conduct.93
Victims could also potentially bring suit under the privacy tort of
public disclosure of private fact.94 Here, a plaintiff would have to

prove the publicized matter (presumably the nonconsensual image)
is of a kind that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person
and is not of legitimate concern to the public.95 Victims, depending on their specific circumstances, could possibly succeed with
this claim, as publishing a private person’s nude photograph is not
generally a matter that legitimately concerns the public.96 However,
like other tort claims, both IIED and public disclosure impose substantial burdens for victims to overcome through strong language
such as “outrageous,” “severe,” and “highly offensive.”97
While it is true that revenge porn victims have brought claims
in tort and won,98 most victims decline to bring suits for several reasons.99 First, most victims lack the necessary resources and simply
cannot afford it.100 As comedian, John Oliver, humorously articulated the quandary, “most people don’t keep a shoebox full of money
marked: ‘Just in case a total piece of shit tries to ruin my life.’”101
Having funds available to bring suit is even more difficult for victims who have lost their jobs because of the online revenge posts
and are struggling as it is just to pay the rent.102 Resources aside, it
may be challenging simply to find an attorney willing to take the

case. Many lawyers are not familiar with this area of law, and
while some may be sympathetic to victims and offer their services
on a pro bono basis, their numbers are few and their practices subject to geographic limitations.105 In addition, plaintiffs must generally proceed in court under their real, legal names.106 This may dissuade from commencing suit a victim who fears unwanted publicity
or has unofficially changed his or her name for privacy reasons.107
It is even more difficult to secure a remedy for a victim when
a perpetrator is “judgment proof” or unidentifiable. Even in the
most ideal of circumstances, defendants often do not have enough
money to make the victim “whole” again.108 In other cases, victims
cannot identify the perpetrator because he or she is a third person who continues to repost an image on the Internet.109 A victim
would receive little to no remedy in cases like these and, ultimately, might spend thousands of dollars on legal fees without seeing
any result.110 Moreover, regardless of any potential damage awards,
suing a person in tort will not remove the photos from the Internet
and even a preventive injunction cannot guarantee that others will
stop re-posting the image.111
Website operators have no incentive to regulate the activities
of their users or track users down because operators generally have
legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency

Act (CDA). The CDA makes it a crime for an individual to make
obscene material available by computer to anyone.113 However,
Section 230 establishes that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive
computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of
any information provided by another.”114 Courts have interpreted
Section 230 to provide immunity to website operators and Internet service providers in cases where third parties have posted tortious material on their sites.115 Since many websites that are host
to revenge porn images are merely providing a forum for users to
post and are not themselves responsible for the “creation or development of the information,”116 website operators would likely be
immune under Section 230.
In this environment, “takedown services,” or websites that
offer to remove a victim’s image from the Internet in return for
a several-hundred dollar fee, have become popular and are often
advertised next to revenge porn images.117 These lucrative businesses are often run by the revenge porn sites themselves, and therefore
have incentive to encourage perpetrators to post images, because
more posts mean more fees from victims desperate to have their
images removed.118 A handful of prominent Internet platforms such
as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Instagram have recently adopted
procedures to assist victims in reporting and removing nonconsensual images.119 While this is helpful to victims after the fact, it neither
prevents nor dissuades perpetrators from posting revenge porn in

the first place, as even an image posted for a brief time on one of
these platforms can cause serious damage to a person’s life.120
Established tort law therefore fails to provide adequate remedies for victims, who must look elsewhere for justice.
2.

Copyright
At first glance, copyright law may appear to be a more viable
option for victims seeking to remove unwanted images from the
Internet, because while Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act immunizes websites from tort claims, it does not immunize
websites from federal intellectual property claims.121 If a victim created the original image herself, then she is considered the copyright
owner122 and is entitled to protection under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA). Under Section 512 of the DMCA, a victim
may file a notice against a website to have an infringing item (in this
case, the victim’s photograph) removed from the site.123 However,
in order to seek protection under Section 512, the copyright owner
must register the copyright.124 This is a problem in the context of
revenge porn.
While registering a copyright is not logistically challenging, doing so for the purpose of protecting a revenge porn image
requires the victim to be exposed “all over again—this time to
the government.”125 So, ironically, to copyright an image and stop
strangers from seeing their nude pictures, victims have to send more
pictures of their naked body to more strangers (the individuals at

B.

Current Criminal Laws Are Ineffective
Existing federal and state criminal laws are just as ineffective
as tort and copyright law at addressing revenge porn. Twenty-three
states lack criminal statutes specifically aimed at revenge porn,130
forcing prosecutors to rely on other criminal theories in order to
convict a revenge porn perpetrator. Some argue that specific statutes criminalizing revenge porn are unnecessary, since criminal
harassment and stalking laws already apply to the distribution of
sexual images.131 However, in practice, prosecutors have a difficult
time convicting revenge porn perpetrators under state and federal
harassment and stalking laws for a variety of reasons.132
First, criminal harassment and stalking statutes require showing that the defendant has engaged in a pattern or in repeated
behavior.133 For example, the federal stalking statute states that it
is a felony to use any “interactive computer service” to “engage
in a course of conduct” that places an individual in reasonable
fear of death or serious bodily injury or that would reasonably be

“For His Eyes Only”

“expected to cause substantial emotional distress.” Because a
conviction requires proving the defendant engaged in a “course of
conduct,” a perpetrator who posted an image just once is unlikely
to be convicted, no matter that the single post may have metastasized via downstream distribution and destroyed the victim’s professional life and mental health. The statute also requires proof that
the defendant acted with the intent to “kill, injure, harass, or intimidate.”135 If a defendant can convince the jury that he posted the
images for the sole purpose of self-amusement, and not to harm the
victim, then he can again expect an acquittal.136
Second, some state harassment laws require that the defendant’s conduct be aimed directly at the victim.137 In People v. Barber, a 2014 case, a New York trial court dismissed harassment
charges against a man who posted naked images of a woman to his
Twitter account and sent the images to the victim’s employer and
sister.138 The court’s rationale for the dismissal was that the man did
not send any of the images to the victim herself, and “[a]bsent any
communication directly to the complainant,” there was no harassment under New York law.139 According to Mary Anne Franks, a
University of Miami Law School professor, “[People v. Barber is]
a textbook example of why there’s a gap in the law.”140 Under this
interpretation of the statute, a person who posts revenge porn to a
website (or a dozen websites) but makes no direct contact with the
victim cannot be charged with harassment. By extension, victims in
other states may face similar issues with harassment statutes also
drawn to require conduct aimed directly at the victim.
In turn, a majority of U.S. state legislatures have implicitly
recognized that revenge porn is not adequately addressed in their
criminal codes. Twenty-seven states have adopted laws criminalizing revenge porn.141 However, these laws vary widely in terms of
how they treat perpetrators.142 The variance in penalties for convicted perpetrators, and the fact that twenty-three states have

failed to criminalize revenge porn altogether, serves to undermine
efforts to acknowledge revenge porn as a serious offense with cruel
consequences for victims.143
Neither the threat of civil litigation nor criminal penalties
(where they exist) is enough to dissuade perpetrators of revenge
porn.144 Civil litigation is impractical and often compounds the harm
suffered by victims, by imposing substantial legal fees on plaintiff-victims and/or forcing them to publicly register the images that
have caused them such distress.145 Most criminal statutes—where
they even exist at all—fail to adequately deter perpetrators from
continuing to post because of ever-shifting loopholes engendered
by technological development.146 Victims need a comprehensive
federal criminal statute to step in where states have failed.
III. Proposal
In order to effectively deter the dissemination of nonconsensual pornography and ensure justice for victims, I propose that
Chapter 109A of the United States Code regarding Sexual Abuse147
should be amended to provide language targeted at criminalizing
such activity. The likely result of a national amendment would be
the elimination of jurisdictional gaps, and the creation of a nationwide standard to which perpetrators can expect to be held accountable. If modeled after Illinois’ Non-consensual Dissemination of
Private Sexual Images law, such an amendment would address the
failings of most current state criminal laws as well as loopholes created by technical advancements.148

adding the following language, creating § 2242A: Nonconsensual
Dissemination of Sexual Images:149

The Illinois statute uses the phrase “private sexual images.” In drafting,
I have intentionally removed the word “private” in the title of the proposed
statute and offense as it can connote that the image was received in the confines of a private relationship. The statute should be broad enough to also cover
images taken without the subject’s consent (e.g., in situations of rape or in situations of hackers tapping into a person’s computer camera without consent).

“Sexual act” as defined under § 2246 should be expanded to include “any
transfer or transmission of semen upon any part of the clothed or unclothed
body of the victim, for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal of the victim or another.” 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-23.5 (a)(2) (2015).
151
Both “sexual act” and “sexual contact” are already defined within chapter 109A in § 2246. 18 U.S.C. § 2246 (2012). However, “sexual act” should be
expanded. See supra note 150. Under § 2246, “sexual act” means—
(A) contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus,
and for purposes of this subparagraph contact involving the penis occurs upon penetration, however slight;
(B) contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva,
or the mouth and the anus;
(C) the penetration, however slight, of the anal or genital opening of
another by a hand or finger or by any object, with an intent to abuse,
humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person; or
(D) the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia
of another person who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual
desire of any person.
“Sexual Contact” means the intentional touching, either directly or
through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh,
or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass,
degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. 18 U.S.C.

(2) Obtains the image under circumstances in which
a reasonable person would know or understand that
image was to remain private;152 and
(3) Knows or should have known that the person in the
image has not consented to the dissemination.153
B. The following acts are exempt from the provisions in
this section:
	
(1) Dissemination of images involving voluntary
exposure in public or commercial settings; or
	(2) Dissemination made to aid a criminal investigation that is otherwise lawful, to report unlawful conduct, or to serve a lawful public purpose.154
I also propose that the punishment for dissemination of such
images mirror the punishment for federal cyber-stalking,155 in which
defendants can be punished for up to five years in jail, fined up to
$250,000, or both.156 As a substitute for tort relief, victims should be
entitled to full and timely restitution as a remedy for any harm they
suffered as a result of the offender’s actions.157
B.

Effects of Proposed Legislation
The proposed amendment would be successful because (1)
it focuses on intent to disseminate rather than intent to harm, (2)
it includes “selfies” within the scope of nonconsensual pornography, (3) it punishes victim identification, (4) images covered
by the legislation are not limited to those featuring nudity, (5) it
holds tertiary distributors liable, and (7) it imposes harsh penalties.
The proposed amendment is therefore a sweeping response to a
multi-dimensional problem and, as written, would likely survive a
Constitutional challenge.

152
A reasonable person might understand an image is meant to remain
private in circumstances where the image is shared only between an intimate
couple. See supra Part II(C) and accompanying footnotes. For example, a reasonable person in the circumstances would likely have understood that LaJuan
Wood’s images were meant to remain private. See supra Part II(A) and accompanying footnotes.

1.

The Focus Is on Intent to Disseminate, Not Intent to Harm
Currently, some state criminal statutes require that the
offender intended to cause severe emotional distress to the victim
in order to possibly be held criminally liable for revenge porn.158
While the intent to cause emotional distress may motivate the
offender’s behavior—such as the stereotypical break up revenge
scenario—perpetrators disseminate images for a variety of reasons.159 For instance, after news broke that members of a Penn State
fraternity had uploaded photos of unconscious, naked women to
private Facebook pages, a fraternity member defended the conduct
to reporters by insisting that it “wasn’t malicious whatsoever. It
wasn’t intended to hurt anyone… It was an entirely satirical group
and it was funny to some extent.”160 Or, in the words of the proprietor of a once popular revenge porn site, “I call it entertainment. . . .
[W]e just want the pictures there for entertainment purposes and
business. . . . [O]ur business goal is to become big and profitable.”161
Thus, intent-to-harm requirements distinguish between victims of
the same conduct, and prohibit some victims’ recovery based on
factors completely outside of the victims’ control.162 Including an
intent-to-harm requirement also incentivizes perpetrators to continue such conduct so long as they can plausibly deny an intent to
hurt anyone.163
In contrast, by merely requiring intent to disseminate, the proposed statute gives priority to the victims. After all, the harm suffered in nonconsensual pornography cases is devastating regardless
of the motive.164 The proposed amendment would therefore remedy a wider group of victims and dissuade offenders who publish
revenge porn simply for entertainment or profit.

Selfies
Any law criminalizing revenge porn must include liability for
images that originated as selfies, as failure to do so would prohibit
recovery for up to 80 percent of victims.165 California’s statute criminalizing revenge porn, which has since been amended to include
self-taken images, originally limited the scope of the law to include
only images taken by the perpetrator.166 The statute punished any
person who photographed or recorded another and then proceeded
to distribute the image with the intent to cause serious emotional
distress.167 Though California prosecutors were able to get its first
conviction under this version of the statute,168 the original language
precluded prosecution in most revenge porn cases because of its
exclusion of “selfies.”169 By simply using the word “image” without
specifying a requirement for its origin, the proposed amendment
would apply to images taken by the victim, by the perpetrator, or
by a third party.
3.

Doxxing
Posting personal information in connection with a revenge
porn image can exponentially increase the harm suffered by the
victim.170 Besides deterring perpetrators from publishing identifying information in connection with an image, Part A(1)(b) of the
proposed amendment also acts as a safeguard for alleged perpetrators who commit “victimless” crimes. Because Part A(1)(b) would
define an image as nonconsensual pornography only when the subject of the image can be identified either visually or through other
information accompanying the image, it protects against frivolous
and unwarranted prosecution. Without a requirement that the subject be identifiable to others, the law would be overly broad and
possibly lead to the criminalization of victimless and otherwise lawful acts.171

Images Without Nudity
A revenge porn law should recognize that not all intimate
sexual acts involve nudity.172 Expanding the definition of “sexual
act” within Chapter 109A to also include “any transfer or transmission of semen upon any part of the clothed or unclothed body
of the victim”173 would impose liability when an image shows a victim who has been ejaculated upon, regardless of whether the victim
is nude.174 A narrowly drafted law only concerned with images of
nudity fails to consider the full scope of images that would cause
harm if distributed without the subject’s consent.175
In 2015, Congresswoman Jackie Speier introduced a discussion draft of a bill to make revenge porn a federal crime by amending Chapter 88 of Title 18 within the United States Code.176 Unfortunately, the statute would apply only to images depicting “sexually
explicit conduct, the naked genitals or post-pubescent female nipple of a person,” and in any case, the bill has gone nowhere.177 It
is time for a renewed push for a federal law that would apply to
images that feature sexual acts or sexual contact even when the
subject is clothed.178
5.

Liability for Downstream Distributors
Several state laws punish only the original publisher of
revenge porn, which does nothing to deter downstream distributors
from continuing to repost images on other platforms.179 By expanding (or limiting, depending on one’s point of view) liability to those
who knew or reasonably should have known that the images they

distributed were intended to be private and that no consent by
the subject was given, the proposed amendment accomplishes two
things at once. First, it prevents the potential for limitless liability,
as it takes into account whether a reasonable person in the downstream distributor’s position would have understood that the image
was meant to be private and that the victim had not consented to its
dissemination.180 At the same time, in our era of “viral” images that
can rack up thousands of views within just days or hours,181 the reasonable person standard will help deter downstream posters when
it is clear that an image is being distributed nonconsensually.182

Penalties
Society has long since recognized the notion that the punishment should fit the crime, (“Culpae poenae par esto”), and whether it be under a utilitarian theory yielding deterrence or a retributive theory, revenge porn should be classified as a felony with
appropriate sentences. Because the harm inflicted on victims can
be severe, those guilty of disseminating revenge porn should face
serious penalties.183 However, state laws criminalizing revenge porn
vary regarding the punishments available, and are split on classifying the crime as a misdemeanor or as a felony.184 There are several
problems with categorizing revenge porn as a mere misdemeanor.185 First, it sends a message to victims that the harm they suffered is not taken seriously by society.186 Generally, misdemeanors
carry sentences of no more than a year imprisonment,187 and such
a classification would put revenge porn on the same level as lesser
crimes such as petty theft and public intoxication. Second, a misdemeanor classification decreases incentives for law enforcement to
dedicate significant time and resources to investigating such conduct.188 Victims of misdemeanor harassment, for example, are often
told that their cases are not serious enough to warrant an in-depth

investigation. Lastly, classifying revenge porn as a misdemeanor
as opposed to a felony provides a weak deterrent, as perpetrators
know their actions will not be punished as harshly as are other sexual-abuse related crimes.190
Applying cyber-stalking punishments to revenge porn underscores the seriousness of the crime. For many victims, the effects
of revenge porn reverberate for a long time: many lose their jobs,
are forced to change their names, 191 and some feel compelled to go
into hiding for their safety. For others, it is a death sentence: many
victims struggle with suicidal thoughts, 192 and some victims have
even taken their own lives. Therefore, because the harm suffered is
quite severe, the penalty for causing such harm should be justifiably
serious.193
189

C.

Free Speech Challenges
The biggest obstacle to federal revenge porn legislation is
free speech concerns arising under the First Amendment.194 It is the
hallmark of free speech protections that a “free trade in ideas” is
allowed even if the majority of people find those ideas distasteful,195
and courts have firmly established that posting explicit images on
the Internet is a form of speech.196 Thus, on its face, a federal statute against nonconsensual pornography would be a content-based
regulation of speech,197 and may even chill legitimate protected
speech.198
Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.199 However, the protections afforded by the First Amendment are not

absolute. There are certain classes of speech that may be regulated and restricted without violating the Constitution.201 The
Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Stevens outlines
several categories of speech that Congress is constitutionally permitted to restrict: obscenity, defamation, fraud, speech that incites
illegal activity, and speech integral to criminal conduct.202 Prior to
Stevens, the Court recognized additional types of unprotected free
speech such as threats,203 fighting words,204 child pornography,205 and
obscene speech that met a narrow test.206 The Court has explained
in multiple instances that these restrictions are justified because the
speech is “of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the
social interest in order and morality.”207
A federal statute restricting the nonconsensual distribution of
pornography therefore would likely survive constitutional scrutiny
because it falls within an already recognized category of unprotected speech: obscenity. At least one First Amendment scholar, UCLA
Law Professor Eugene Volokh, agrees that sexually intimate images
distributed of nonconsenting subjects likely fall under the category
of obscenity and do not receive First Amendment protections.208
The Court’s current test for obscenity, set out in Miller v. California, supports a finding that nonconsensual pornography would
be considered obscene.209 The guidelines for determining whether
material is obscene are:
(a) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary
community standards’ would find that the work, taken
as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether

the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a
whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.210
The Court further provided two “plain examples” of “sexual
conduct” that could be regulated under part (b) of the test: “[p]
atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated” and “[p]atently
offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.”211 Therefore,
disseminating images that expose an individual whether nude or
engaging in a sexual act without that individual’s consent and “in a
context where there’s good reason to think that the subject did not
consent to publication of such pictures”212 would likely qualify as a
“[p]atently offensive representation” of sexual conduct, appealing
to a prurient interest.213 Such images offer no “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,” and thus, would likely be obscene
to the average person.214
Even if courts decline to categorize revenge porn as obscene,
so long as they recognize that revenge porn is not a matter of public concern, it would be afforded less protection and thus subject
to reasonable regulation. Free speech is not just fundamental as
an individual right, but “as a safeguard for the social processes of
democracy;”215 and at its core is the protection of speech regarding
matters of public concern.216 In Snyder v. Phelps, the Supreme Court
emphasized the difference between speech regarding matters of
public concern and speech regarding purely private matters.217

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

[Vol. 23.101

Speech on matters of public concern “occupies the highest rung of
the hierarchy of First Amendment values, and is entitled to special
protection,” 218 whereas speech regarding private matters is entitled
to “less rigorous” protection.219
Sexually explicit images posted to the Internet without the
subject’s consent are matters of private concern.220 Failing to regulate this type of private speech actually chills individuals’ private
expression, out of fear that their private images might someday
become public on the Internet.221 Therefore, restrictions on revenge
porn might in fact “foster[] private speech.”222
As a result of these free speech concerns, the proposed
amendment contains exceptions for images disseminated lawfully
and for a legitimate purpose, and for images of voluntary nudity in
a public or commercial setting.223 Without these exceptions, the law
would criminalize dissemination of commercial pornography and
some artworks as well as disclosures made in the public interest,
and would likely run afoul of the First Amendment.224
Distributing images in order to bring potentially unlawful
conduct to the attention of law enforcement or for another legitimate journalistic purpose serves the public interest and should
therefore be excluded from potential prosecution.225 Likewise, the
voluntary exposure in public or commercial settings exception protects lawful pornography, which the Supreme Court has recognized
as protected under the First Amendment.226 It also protects artistic expression, excluding liability for artists who create and publish
speech on purely private matters does not implicate the same constitutional
concerns as limiting speech on matters of public interest”).

nude images with the consent of the subject, as well as theatrical
productions involving nudity.227 As Carrie Goldberg of the Cyber
Civil Rights Initiative writes in regards to similar exceptions in the
Illinois law, “[N]o journalist ever has to fear being prosecuted under
this law for publishing photographs of a topless protest and no porn
enthusiast needs to worry about going to jail for forwarding links to
his [or her] favorite commercial hardcore sites.”228
A narrowly drawn federal statute prohibiting the dissemination of nonconsensual pornography that provides exceptions for matters of public concern and for voluntary exposure
in public and commercial settings would therefore likely pass
constitutional muster.
Conclusion
Current laws, both federal and state, offer little or no deterrent to perpetrators of revenge porn and provide virtually no remedy for victims.229 Tort law, copyright law, and criminal statutes
addressing harassment and stalking are all awkward fits for the
problem, and rarely succeed at redressing the victim or sanctioning
the perpetrator. Where they exist, state laws specifically addressing
revenge porn are often designed in a way that thwarts prosecution
in a significant number of cases, or provides minimal punishment
for offenders.230 It is foolish to hope that preaching at individuals
to stop creating and sending intimate photos and videos will make
the phenomenon of revenge porn disappear. A federal criminal
statute would validate the devastating harm suffered by victims,231
reinforce the freedom of expression and of confidentiality that individuals have within their private relationships,232 and deter future
offenses by imposing harsh penalties.233 Federal legislation ought
to be enacted to help victims like Annmarie see their tormentors
brought to justice and their suffering redressed.
