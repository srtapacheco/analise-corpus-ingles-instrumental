HOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
BATTERERS USE CUSTODY
PROCEEDINGS IN FAMILY COURTS TO
ABUSE VICTIMS, AND HOW COURTS
CAN PUT A STOP TO IT
Emmaline Campbell*
I. Introduction
Domestic violence batterers are master manipulators who
find creative ways to abuse their victims, even after the relationship
ends. Domestic violence is defined as “a pattern of behavior in a
relationship by which the batterer attempts to control his victim
through a variety of tactics.”1 Batterers’ tactics “are more than physical violence and induce a penumbra of threats and actions to induce
fear, humiliation, social isolation, and resource deprivation.”2 These
tactics can include psychological and emotional abuse, destruction
of property and harming of pets, forcing victims into isolation, creating economic abuse, and enforcing rigid expectations of gender
roles.3 All of these tactics have one purpose: controlling the victim.4
Batterers are often very angry when victims end a relationship. When the victim leaves, she exercises her autonomy and
escapes the batterer’s hold.5 Many batterers react violently to this.

Victims report increased and more severe violence after separation, referred to as “separation assault.”6 In one study, 35 percent
of victims reported more severe violence after separation.7 Some
batterers even kill their victims after separation. A victim’s risk
of being killed by her batterer increases six-fold when she leaves
her batterer.8
When a victim leaves her battering spouse and seeks to end
the marriage, the batterer often does not willingly relinquish control over her. Instead, he takes advantage of the divorce and custody process as an avenue to continue his abuse. This paper will focus
on the ways in which batterers take advantage of custody proceedings in family court to continue to abuse their victims.
The batterer’s use of coercion during the custody process can
take many forms. It can include demanding custody simply for the
sake of staying involved in the victim’s life; forcing the victim to
return to court dozens of times to prolong contact; using court-mandated visitation or custody as an opportunity to commit physical
violence against the victim; intimidating the victim into conceding
joint custody during coercive mediation sessions; and refusing to
pay child support to force the victim back into court.
This paper will address the many ways that batterers use the
family court system to perpetuate abuse against their victims. At
present, most family courts are unprepared to address batterers’
attempts to use the court and the legal system as a tool of abuse.9
This paper will offer recommendations for how family courts can
stop batterers from manipulating the courts as a site of abuse.
II. The Context Of Abuse: Victim And Batterer Psychology
In order to understand how the family court system results in
unfair outcomes for victims, it is necessary first to understand the
psychological profiles of victims and abusers.
A.

Victim Psychology
Abuse can make people react in unpredictable ways. Many
domestic violence survivors “may present as angry, distrustful, and
suspicious with all professionals related to the court proceedings.”10

This response is a normal reaction to the trauma of abuse. But many
judges expect victims to appear “victimized or helpless.”11 When
victims do not appear helpless but seem angry, the court may draw
adverse inferences about these behaviors and assume the victim
is purposefully acting uncooperative or difficult.12 Based on these
assumptions, judges may be sympathetic to the abuser and more
readily believe his claims.
Battered women may also exhibit psychological symptoms
that confuse judges. Many battered women suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can lead them to display “a
strange lack of affect when discussing the violence, or to giggle
inappropriately.”13 Trauma can also affect victims’ memories, leading them to have difficulty articulating events in chronological
order.14 Courts may misinterpret these behaviors as a sign that the
victim is lying or not credible.
B.

Batterer Psychology
Batterers often have a psychological profile that creates a positive first impression. Batterers may present as “charming, charismatic, likeable, reasonable, generous, and even flexible.”15 Batterers
can be highly manipulative and carefully craft their image.16 Many
batterers can be abusive at home in private, but to the outside world
they appear to be caring and devoted family men.17 When judges
encounter batterers in court, they are often swayed by the batterers’
accounts of events, which, in contrast to the victims’ accounts, seem
reasonable and rational, and thus more credible.18
Batterers often take advantage of their likeable façade to present false narratives to the court about the abuse. Many batterers are

described by their own counselors as “skillfully dishonest.”19 Batterers often lie or distort facts about the abuse in court.20 Batterers
may also falsely accuse victims of infidelity or sexual promiscuity, in
an effort to diminish the victim’s credibility with the court.21 Other batterers have falsely alleged that victims had mental health or
drug problems.22 Many batterers have claimed that the victim committed physical abuse against them, shifting the focus away from
the victim and forcing the court to untangle the variety of abuse
allegations in the case.23
Many batterers deny the abuse. Some counselors who work
with batterers have noted that their clients give a “passionate and
eloquent denial of the abuse and the impact of their own conduct
on others.”24 Some batterers claim that their victims have manufactured the allegations of abuse in order to gain an advantage in their
custody cases.25
When batterers do admit to committing abuse, they may use
tactics to minimize the violence.26 Batterers may allege that the
fights the victim has described also included acts of violence committed by the victim.27 In other cases, the batterer might admit to
minor acts of violence, like shoving, in order to make the more serious and denied allegations seem less credible.28
Some batterers may even use their knowledge of the victim’s
psychology against her. Batterers may claim the victim’s anger
and assertiveness in court demonstrate that she is not a real victim and that her abuse allegations are false.29 Other batterers focus
on attacking the victim’s emotional state. In custody proceedings,
batterers often claim that victims are “too unstable” to care for
children, even where the instability is temporary and a direct result
of the abuse.30

C.

Batterer-Victim Dynamics
Batterers exert power over victims to undermine the victims’
autonomy while increasing their own power. Where the victim is a
mother, the batterer tends to challenge her parental authority and
tries to create tensions between her and the children.31 As a result,
she may have difficulty controlling the children’s behavior. Custody
evaluators may find that domestic violence victims are not effective parents if they cannot control the children.32 Evaluators may
be persuaded by a father’s portrayal of himself as a powerful figure,
and the children may behave better in his care due to their fear of
him.33 Children may even request to be placed with the batterer as
a result of traumatic bonding.34 These behaviors often lead custody
evaluators to recommend some amount of custody for the batterer.
Batterers may seem more credible than victims based on
their psychological profiles. Many “judges and evaluators lacking
in-depth knowledge about domestic violence and PTSD may easily
be misled into trusting the calm, sincere-sounding accused’s veracity more than the ‘strange’ or emotional purported-victim’s.”35 When
a judge must decide whether the batterer or the victim’s account
of abuse is true, the batterer’s account may win out because of a
perception that he is more credible.36
D.

How Batterer Psychology is Favored by Law: Friendly-Parent
Provisions
As discussed above, batterers often portray themselves as the
reasonable and flexible parent.37 In contrast, victims may appear
rigid and uncooperative for being unwilling to maintain a co-parenting relationship with the batterer.38 The National Council of
Juvenile and Family Court Judges notes that “it is often legitimate
for the partner of an abusive parent to try to protect the children
from exposure to abuse, or to try to secure his or her own safety from the abusive partner by limiting that partner’s contact with
the children.”39

But unfortunately, many child-custody laws are built to favor
“generous” batterers over “protective” victims. According to the
American Bar Association, as of 2008, 32 states included “friendly-parent” presumptions as a factor in the analysis of the best interest of the child.40 Friendly-parent presumptions assume that “in all
child custody cases the parent who was the most generous in sharing the child with the other parent would have a greater ability to
understand and provide for the child’s needs.”41
Some states, including California, have recognized that
friendly-parent provisions should not be applied in domestic violence cases.42 However, this does not fully resolve the problem. For
friendly-parent provisions not to apply, the court must first make a
finding of domestic violence.43 If the court believes the batterer and
not the victim, then the domestic violence exception does not kick
in, and the friendly-parent provision still applies.
Unlike California, not all states have recognized that friendly-parent provisions should be inapplicable in domestic violence
cases. “Although every state has made domestic violence (‘DV’)
a factor that courts must consider in custody cases, and at least
24 have a presumption that batterers not be given custody, studies show that batterers still win custody in states with the [Friendly-Parent Provision] unless a statute clarifies that it does not apply
when there is DV.”44 Friendly-parent provisions create risks for the
children of domestic violence abusers and continue to be applied in
many cases nationally, even when one parent has had a history of
perpetrating domestic violence.

alienation” has been used by batterers to claim that the victim
manipulated the children into disliking the batterer.45 In parental
alienation, a parent ostensibly “creates misrepresentations of the
other parent in the child’s head in the hopes that the child will
alienate that other parent.”46 The National Council of Juvenile and
Family Court Judges has noted that the scientific community has
discredited parental alienation theory and it should not be admissible in court.47
Though parental alienation has been discredited, some courts
continue to apply it or reference it. A recent decision in Connecticut notes that, “Like other jurisdictions, Connecticut has not passed
on the issue of whether parental alienation syndrome is a reliable
theory.”48 In one case in Louisiana, the court drew at length from a
journal article on parental alienation, quoting, “The alienated parent typically is a ‘good’ parent who has no history or physical or
emotional abuse of the child, and while there may be some ‘kernel of truth’ to the child’s complaints about the rejected parent,
the child’s grossly negative views and feelings are a significantly
distorted and exaggerated reaction.”49 Despite the fact that parental alienation has been discredited, its legacy lives on in the minds
of some judges.
F.

Solutions
Ruling on domestic violence allegations often proves uniquely challenging for judges. Judges cannot rely on their gut instincts
about whether the victim or batterer is more credible. Instead,
courts must engage in careful fact-finding to determine if accusations of domestic violence are true. Courts should consider looking
to the following resources for further evidence: testimony from other family members or friends, service providers, counselors, police
reports, criminal case records, restraining order records, medical
records, and school records.50

Mediation is often praised as a less adversarial way to handle
divorce and custody cases. In mediation, an impartial third party
(a “mediator”) facilitates the resolution of divorce and custody
disputes to reach agreement between the parties.51 Supporters of
mediation say that it is less costly, more efficient, and produces better outcomes than traditional custody litigation.52
However, mediation has come under significant criticism in
cases of domestic violence. Mediation puts victims of domestic
violence at a huge disadvantage in custody proceedings.53 Because
of the power imbalance in the batterer-victim relationship, victims
often feel disempowered when the batterer is present and unable
to voice their needs or the needs of their children during mediation.54 The National Council on Juvenile and Family Court Judges
recommends that judges consider not requiring mediation in cases
involving domestic violence, where state law allows.55
Mediation can be voluntary or mandatory, depending on state
law.56 Each state determines whether all custody disputes in the
state must be mediated, or whether there are opt-out provisions
or other exceptions for domestic violence or other reasons.57 Fortunately, the majority of states have banned mediation in domestic
violence cases.58 Other states allow victims of domestic violence to
opt-out of mediation.59 The American Bar Association reports that
as of 2014, only eighteen states require domestic violence victims to

engage in mediation (with five states leaving it up to the discretion
of the court), without allowing them to opt out.60
Unfortunately, California is one of those states.61 In California, mediation in custody disputes is mandatory even in cases of
domestic violence.62 California adopted mandatory mediation in
1981 because custody cases in need of litigation heavily overburdened the family courts.63 In mandatory mediation, the judge plays
a significantly more limited role in custody proceedings. Instead,
the mediator spends time with the parties discussing arrangements.
This delegation saves the court a substantial amount of time.
The Judicial Council of California has examined the problems of mediation for victims of domestic violence, but determined
that mandatory mediation is an essential part of keeping the family courts running in California. The Council wrote, “To suggest
that mediation be made voluntary has the potential of crippling a
severely burdened court system. When family law judges already
report that they have insufficient time to handle grueling calendars,
a suggestion that would increase that caseload by a large margin is
untenable.”64 This is California’s position despite the fact that in the
majority of other states, courts are able to manage their family law
caseloads without requiring victims of domestic violence to enter
mediation. California should reconsider whether the efficiency of
mediation outweighs the disadvantages of forced mediation for victims of domestic violence.
2.

Victims and Batterers Cannot Negotiate on Fair Terms
Mediation, by its nature, is likely to produce better outcomes
for batterers than for victims. The National Council of Juvenile
and Family Court Judges notes that an abuser may favor mediation because the abuser knows he can coerce the victim more easily during the process of mediation than in traditional litigation.65
This is because in relationships with a history of violence, even
after the relationship ends, the victim may feel unable to assert her

interests. The victim may feel compelled to capitulate to the batterer’s custody demands, even when the demands are contrary to
the best interest of their child.67 The victim may fear that the abuser will retaliate if she stands up for herself—perhaps by physically attacking her after the mediation session.68 These fears are not
unreasonable; many women report being battered after attending
mediation with their abusers.69
The egalitarian principles of mediation cannot overtake years
of reinforced behavioral patterns. “Throughout the abusive relationship, the abused spouse has been conditioned to relent, compromise, and conform to be safe from [violence]. This learned pattern
of dealing with her abuser cannot be easily broken, especially in a
process that requires compromise.”70 These patterns make it difficult
for a victim to assert herself for the first time during mediation.71
Mediation is also concerning for victims because they are
often not represented by an attorney in the proceedings.72 In traditional litigation, a victim could hire an attorney and allow the
attorney to advocate on her behalf. In mediation in California, the
parties’ attorneys may attend at the discretion of the mediator, but
are not allowed to speak for their clients.73 Mediators have a right
to remove attorneys from the room if the attorney attempts to participate in the mediation.74 In mediation, attorneys are not allowed
to support victims in the way that litigation allows.
For these reasons, many people support ending the requirement for mediation in domestic violence cases.75 The National
Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges has recommended

that mediation “not be mandated or referred in cases in which
[domestic violence] has been alleged.”76
3.

Mediators are Unequipped to Handle Domestic Violence
Cases
Mediators are frequently not well trained on domestic violence issues, and they are typically not equipped to address the
unique needs of a domestic violence victim in mediation. Certification for mediators may require very minimal training on domestic
violence.77 In California, mediators must receive only 16 hours of
training in their first year of work and subsequently receive update
training for 4 hours per year.78
Mediators may be unable to properly screen for domestic violence and may overlook many cases in which domestic violence is
present. In a study of mediation reports in San Diego, researchers
found that the mediator only accounted for domestic violence in
43.1 percent of cases where the screening form filled out by the
client had an explicit domestic violence allegation.79 Even in cases where a temporary restraining order had been issued and was
documented in the screening form, the mediator addressed domestic violence in the mediation report only 49.4 percent of the time.80
Other studies have similarly found that mediators are frequently
unable to identify cases involving domestic violence.81
Some mediators are even hostile to claims of domestic violence. In one study, researchers found that “women who informed
custody mediators that they were victims of domestic violence
often received less favorable custody awards.”82 Mediators may suspect that women who report domestic violence are manufacturing
the allegations for custody purposes, and they may punish women
who make allegations of domestic violence based on this belief.
Mediators also fail to recommend taking custody away from
batterers. In the San Diego study, mediators recommended joint
custody in 91.4 percent of domestic violence cases, a rate even higher than their average of 90 percent joint custody recommendation
for non-domestic violence cases.83 Even when the father was clearly

a perpetrator of abuse, he received at least some physical custody
in 96.8 percent of cases.84
Courts will enforce mediators’ recommendations, even when
they conflict with the law. In In re Marriage of Fajota, the mediator’s
report explicitly acknowledged the father’s history of domestic violence yet still made a joint custody recommendation, and the trial
court followed this recommendation and granted joint custody.85
The court’s custody grant was later overturned on appeal for its
failure to address the domestic violence issue.
Mediators also may be unprepared to detect abusive behaviors during a mediation session. Within a mediation session, an
abuser may threaten the victim through certain coded phrases or
body language.86 Because of her history with the abuser, the victim understands that she is being threatened, while the mediator
remains oblivious.87 Not only can this continuation of abuse further
traumatize the victim, it may intimidate her to cede ground to the
batterer when negotiating her custody requests.
4.

Solutions
States should allow victims of domestic violence to opt out of
mediation. The majority of states already allow this.88 However, a
number of states, including California, have not implemented this
policy.89 California has tried to address the concerns of victims in
mediation by allowing victims to meet separately with mediators.90
While this is a positive step towards protecting the safety of victims,
it is insufficient. The batterer frequently knows where to find the
victim; if he wants to retaliate and attack her, he will be able to do
it. Separate meetings do not negate the potential for future attacks.
Additionally, even if the parties meet separately, the goal
of mediation is for the parties to agree on some terms. When the
mediator meets with the batterer, and says, “Your partner is seeking
sole custody,” there is no mystery about the victim’s request. The
batterer will know that the victim went against his wishes, and he
can retaliate against her at a later time. In some cases, even with
separate meetings, the victim may be too afraid to ask for what
she and her children need, out of fear that the request will anger

Domestic Violence Batterers

53

If mediation is going to be conducted with couples with
domestic violence histories, it is essential that mediators be highly trained on power differentials. Some advocates believe that a
mediator can deal with power imbalances by exercising his or her
own power in the mediation.91 Under this model, the mediator lays
out ground rules, chooses the topics of discussion, decides who may
speak and for how long, and determines which spouse may present
a proposal to the other.92 These mediators are trained to watch for
specific behaviors indicative of power imbalances, such as threats,
insults, glaring, and passivity.93 With proper training, it is possible
for mediators to become more adept at working with couples with
histories of domestic violence.
Another way to moderate power imbalances in mediation is
to allow the victim to bring an attorney to advocate on her behalf.
“Research in Maine has shown that the presence of attorneys moderates power imbalances and decreases the likelihood of unfairness.
The attorney can act as a support person and as a spokesperson
for the victim.”94 Under the California Family Code, attorneys are
not allowed to advocate for their clients during a mediation, and
can be excluded from mediation by the mediator.95 This provision
should be changed to allow for attorneys to attend mediation sessions and speak on behalf of their clients, especially in cases of
domestic violence.
B.

Litigation Abuse
While mediation poses problems for victims, litigated custody battles also create opportunities for abuse. “Litigation abuse” is
defined as the batterer’s use of the court system as a tool of coercive
control over the victim.96 Batterers often pursue litigation abuse as
a tactic for several reasons: it is one of the few remaining ways that
they can control a victim after separation, it can drain the victim’s
financial resources, and family courts allow for parties to demand
many hearings.
1.

Litigation as the Only Contact Left
Litigation abuse is a common tactic for batterers because it
is often the only way left for batterers to stay in contact with their
victims.97 After the end of a relationship, a victim typically try to put

distance between herself and the batterer. But when a batterer files
a motion in court, the victim is forced to respond.98 Even if a victim
has a restraining order or criminal protective order against the batterer, if the batterer files a motion to modify custody or visitation,
then the batterer may get the chance to see the victim in court.99
2.

Financial Motives for Litigation Abuse
Litigation is expensive. Batterers may pursue custody litigation in order to financially drain their victims, as custody litigation
is costly.100 A study of custody expenses for battered women found
that their average court-related costs exceeded $90,000.101 These
expensive proceedings are often a hardship for battered women, as
women’s income tends to decrease significantly after divorce. “[O]
ne study noted that the average post-divorce per capita income of
wives and children approximates 68 percent of their before-divorce
per capita income; whereas, the per capita income of husbands
increased by 182 percent after divorce.”102 Victims of domestic violence are also likely to face even more dire economic conditions
than other women going through divorce. Victims of domestic violence may also have suffered from economic abuse throughout the
marriage, where the abuser prevented the victim from having money of her own or hid the family’s money from her.103 By the time of
divorce, she may have very limited financial resources left.
When abused women are forced to spend all of their resources on fighting custody proceedings, it may seriously impact their
ability to stay away from the batterer. Some research has found that
when victims have limited resources to pay for legal representation,
they may return to their abusive relationships at a rate of around
50 percent.104 Batterers may thus coerce victims into returning to
the relationship by draining them of economic resources, leaving
victims without other options for financial stability.
Victims may also lose their jobs as a result of litigation abuse.
If the victim is constantly required to appear in court to attend
hearings, she may miss many days of work.105 While most employers

will excuse a few absences, if the victim continues to miss work for
months on end, she may risk losing her job.106
3.

Frequency of Motions Allowed in Family Court
Court processes are easy for batterers to exploit because
family court proceedings typically lack finality and are susceptible
to frequent motions for updates and changes.107 In most areas of
law, final judgments and settlements end litigation, but verdicts in
family court are open to frequent modifications.108 Because custody
agreements are formulated based on the child’s best interest and
based on the situation of each parent, as the child’s interests change
or a parent’s situation changes, opportunities to revise the custody
agreement arise.109 Batterers may petition for changes to custody
every time there is a minor change in the child or parent’s situation.
4.

Power Differentials in Representation
While batterers commonly hire attorneys to represent them
in custody proceedings, most victims do not.110 Many victims cannot afford to hire an attorney.111 This places victims at a serious
disadvantage in custody proceedings. Parents represented by attorneys are more likely to be awarded custody than parents who are
not so represented.112 Without an attorney, victims may have trouble navigating the court system and understanding court rules
and procedures.113
Even if neither parent can afford an attorney, the batterer can
use the power differential between himself and the victim to his
advantage in court. When both parents proceed pro se, the batterer is allowed direct access to the victim in and out of court.114 The
batterer negotiates custody directly with the victim, which allows
him a substantial amount of contact. The batterer may also be able
to cross-examine the victim on the witness stand in court, often a
traumatic experience for the victim.
5.

Tactics of Litigation Abuse
Litigation provides many opportunities for batterers to abuse
victims.115 “Such measures [have] included requests for emergency

hearings, multiple charges of contempt, failing to supply appropriate documents, and accusations against the participants.”116 The
National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges notes that
abusive parents frequently make multiple appearances “seeking to
undo orders that they perceive to be unfavorable to them, even in
the absence of any change in circumstance between hearings.”117
Batterers may request continuances or otherwise seek to postpone final judgment.118 Each time the batterer files a motion, he
has another opportunity to continue his reach into the victim’s life.
6.

Solutions
Family courts can, on their own authority, order the party
bringing excessive motions to pay the attorney’s fees and costs of
the opposing party.119 Courts also have other options to discipline
a batterer who files excessive motions. Courts can ban the batterer
from filing any further actions or motions against the victim without
permission from the court, find the batterer in contempt of court,
or refer the batterer’s attorney for disciplinary action.120 In one
such case, the California Court of Appeal wrote that the batterer’s
appeals were “[T]otally devoid of merit and were brought merely
to continue an ongoing harassment of his ex-wife over custody of
their child. . . . His actions are a sham, frivolous in nature, an abuse
of the court system and deserving of an appropriate sanction.”121
The court imposed financial sanctions on the batterer and ordered
him to pay attorney’s fees to the victim.
If the batterer files frivolous actions against the victim in
another civil court, victims have the option to fight back through
their own legal processes. If a batterer files a frivolous motion
against a victim in a federal court, the victim can ask the judge to
sanction the batterer under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.122 This rule allows judges to deter abusive conduct in the
courts and can result in monetary damages being awarded to the
victim of the litigation abuse.123
Most batterers’ claims against victims are filed in state courts,
and thus the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply. However, some state legislatures have enacted analogous provisions.124

Domestic Violence Batterers

57

Twenty-eight states, including California and Massachusetts, have
enacted “anti-SLAPP” (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) laws, which protect individuals from being sued frivolously.125 For example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
applied the Massachusetts anti-SLAPP law in a 2002 case. In that
case, the court sanctioned an ex-boyfriend who filed a civil complaint against his ex-girlfriend to retaliate against her after she filed
for a restraining order.126 Applying the state’s anti-SLAPP provision, the court determined that the burden shifted to the ex-boyfriend to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the ex-girlfriend’s petition was “devoid of any reasonable factual
support or any arguable basis in law.”127 The court, finding no such
evidence, ordered the ex-boyfriend to pay the ex-girlfriend’s costs
and attorney’s fees.128 More courts can take advantage of these provisions to deter batterers from committing litigation abuse.
C.

Custody
Custody is the area of family law most susceptible to abuse
from batterers. Because of the high stakes for the victim and children in custody proceedings, batterers can take advantage of the
victim’s fear and demand significant custody rights for the purpose
of staying involved in the victim’s life indefinitely.
1.

Batterers’ Threats About Custody
Even before the first court appearance in a dissolution proceeding, the batterer may have already made threats about custody
to abuse and control the victim. Many batterers threaten that if the
victim leaves, the batterer will be able to take the children away
through a custody action. This is one of several common threats
that batterers make to try to stop their victims from ending the relationship. “In a pilot study of 94 battered women’s experiences with
child custody, batterers’ threats to keep the women from leaving
included hurting the children (25 percent), kidnapping the children
(25 percent), and taking the children through a custody action (35
percent). In this sample, 20 percent of the women reported returning to the batterers at least once because of these threats.”129 Batterwww.domesticshelters.org/domestic-violence-articles-information/how-antislapp-laws-work#.Vv7aAZMrLfZ. [https://perma.cc/Q6N3-GCXF].

ers make threats involving custody because such threats effectually
scare victims into staying with the batterer.
2.

Custody Does Go to Batterers
Batterers’ threats about custody are not hollow; custody does
frequently go to batterers. While in many cases victims do receive
full custody, many batterers continue to receive joint custody.130 A
project in Massachusetts found that out of 40 men who had abused
their wives and children, 15 were granted sole or joint physical custody by the courts.131
Batterers are more likely to seek custody of children than
non-batterer fathers.132 Some researchers have found that men
who abuse their partners contest custody at least twice as often
as non-batterer fathers.133 Batterer fathers tend to stay highly
involved in children’s lives after divorce, in contrast to the general trend of fathers gradually disengaging from their children following divorce.134
Despite laws that require judges to consider domestic violence in their decisions, many judges still wish to give some amount
of custody to batterers. A general belief exists in some courts that
joint custody is in the best interest of children, despite the fact that
no studies have shown that joint custody leads to better outcomes
for children in families with a history of domestic violence.135 Other
scholars suggest that courts continue to give joint custody to batterers to reassure the batterer he “still has a central role to play in the
child’s life.”136 This prioritization of the batterer’s needs over the
needs of the children and victim is highly troubling and pervasive.

Custody Gives Batterers a Tool for Abuse
When batterers are granted custody, they can use the children as a mechanism to stay involved in the life of their victims.

Domestic Violence Batterers

59

In one study, 70 percent of domestic violence victims interviewed
reported that batterers used the children to stay involved in the
victims’ lives.137
Batterers granted joint custody often use custody as an excuse
to stay in communication with the victim. Because of the history of
the power dynamics between the couple, batterers “tend to use the
power of joint parenting to exert control over the other parent.”138
Batterers may “gain access to victims by manufacturing reasons
to ‘discuss’ child rearing or by insisting upon joint attendance at
school events, parent-teacher meetings, or medical appointments.
They can also withhold consent for a child’s counseling, medical
procedures, and extra-curricular school events.”139 In this way, batterers stay involved in the victims’ lives and continue to abuse them.
Batterers can use custody as an opportunity to pass threatening messages through children and back to their mothers.140 One
victim reported that her child told her, “Daddy is going to kill me
with a gun. He’s told me that he bought a book of 1001 ways to
murder somebody.”141 Another victim reported that the batterer
“used his 3-year-old to deliver threats: ‘Does mommy have a boyfriend? Tell mommy I’ll kill her if she has a boyfriend.’”142
Other batterers manipulate victims through disrupting child
care routines. In some cases, batterers deliberately upset family
routines to punish victims for the separation. In one case, a mother reported that the batterer would show up in the middle of the
child’s nap time in order to disturb the family.143 Other batterers
have frequently failed to appear for scheduled visits or arrived
late.144 These disruptions disturb the family routine and leave the
mother and children feeling disoriented. One mother described
such disruptions, stating, “We were splitting up, but he was still controlling my life.”145 One author notes that such disruptions contain
“a powerful message about the abuser’s ability to continue to

4.

Solutions
Courts should seriously consider the risks of granting any
amount of custody to a batterer. All states have enacted statutes
that require courts to consider domestic violence evidence in custody cases, and about half have a rebuttable presumption against
giving custody to a batterer.147 In California, Family Code Section
3044 reads: “Upon a finding by the court that a party seeking custody of a child has perpetrated domestic violence against the other party seeking custody of the child or against the child or the
child’s siblings within the previous five years, there is a rebuttable
presumption that an award of sole or joint physical or legal custody of a child to a person who has perpetrated domestic violence is
detrimental to the best interest of the child, pursuant to [Family
Code] Section 3011. This presumption may only be rebutted by a
preponderance of the evidence.”148
Rebuttable presumption statutes provide an excellent way to
prevent abusive parents from obtaining custody of children. This
presumption is triggered if one parent was convicted of domestic
violence against the other parent or if any court has found that
the parent committed domestic violence against the other parent
or the children.149 One study found that in states with a rebuttable
presumption statute, more custody orders were granted to the victim-mothers, and the batterer-fathers’ visits were limited through
restrictive conditions and a structured schedule.150
If a batterer does receive some form of custody, courts can
still work to protect the victim from excessive in-person contact
with him. To avoid unnecessary and potentially abusive communication between the victim and the batterer, courts can work out a
custody plan in advance that contains a very detailed and precise
visitation order, so there is no need for ongoing interpretation.151 A
detailed visitation order will prevent the batterer from exploiting

any vagueness for the purpose of contacting the victim or bringing
the victim back to court to resolve the dispute.152
Courts should also consider implementing supervised
exchange agreements. In a supervised exchange agreement, the
abuser does not collect the child directly from the victim, but
instead from a third-party, such as the child’s school.153 This remedy
can be excellent when the abuser does not pose a threat to the child
directly, but direct exchanges with the victim could be problematic
and conflict-provoking.154 This method also avoids re-traumatizing
the victim by lessening the constant in-person contact between her
and the abuser and reducing the chance that children will witness
physical abuse.155
D.

Supervised Visitation

1.

The Uses of Supervised Visitation
Sometimes a judge does not feel that it would be safe for a
child and a batterer to be alone together, but the judge still wants to
keep the batterer involved in the child’s life.156 In these cases, courts
may assign supervised visitation.157 Supervised visitation is contact
between a child and a parent that takes place in the presence of a
third party, who monitors safety during the contact.158
Supervised visitation is common in cases of domestic violence.
Studies have found that many batterers are granted supervised visitation with children, even when there is a substantiated claim of
domestic violence.159 One study found that 80 percent of fathers
with a known history of domestic violence still received visitation.160
Supervised visitation can encompass a range of services,
including, at its most intensive level, one-to-one supervision with a
trained observer present at all times.161 There are also less intensive
options for supervision available, including exchange supervision,

under which only the transfer of children at the start and end of
visits is monitored.162
Supervised visitation can be a good resource for courts that
wish to keep a batterer in the child’s life. Supervised visits occur in a
safe setting, where the batterer cannot physically harm the child.163
If the batterer initiates aggressive or manipulative behaviors, the
supervisor can intervene.164 Supervised visits can also reduce a victim’s anxiety about the child’s contact with the batterer, because
the victim knows that the batterer is being carefully monitored.165
Battered women report feeling less anxiety after the court has instituted supervised visitation.166
Supervised visitation still has its limitations. First, there are
concerns that many supervisors at supervised visitation centers
have not been well-trained in detecting abusive behaviors.167 A
supervisor must be trained to be vigilant to not only signs of physical abuse, but also verbal or emotional abuse.168 Second, supervised visitation is not a universal solution that works for every case.
Advocates worry that courts assign supervised visitation too readily, without addressing fundamental questions about whether it is
in the best interest of the child to continue to have contact with
the batterer.169 Third, supervised visitation is always a temporary
measure, and courts must have a plan for what will happen when
the supervised visitation period ends.170 Courts should continuously evaluate the batterer’s progress throughout supervised visitation
and ensure total compliance before awarding the batterer any custody.171 Courts should not transition a batterer from supervised visitation to unsupervised visits merely because the cost of supervised
visitation is high; the court should only end supervised visitation
when there is evidence that it is safe for the batterer to be alone
with the child.

supervised visitation as an opportunity to continue to abuse
their ex-partners.
While supervised visitation centers address some of the problems of batterer abuse, some forms of abuse are still possible inside
the visitation center.172 Even though a batterer may not be able to
physically hit the child in the visitation center, he may be able to
exhibit other abusive behaviors. Some batterers have passed threatening notes to their children at supervised visitation centers.173 Some
batterers have whispered threats to their children, out of hearing
range of visitation center staff.174
Some batterers do not use supervised visitation to focus on
the children at all, but instead remain focused on their victims. For
example, some batterers use visitation as a chance to gather information about victims to plan an assault or stalking by asking the
children about their mother’s address, job, or routines.175 In addition, the visitation center itself can give the batterer an opportunity
to attack. The batterer knows that his victim will be present at the
supervised visitation center to drop off her children. He can plan an
assault accordingly, or follow her home after a visit. In one case, a
woman was murdered in the parking lot of a supervised visitation
center while bringing her child for visitation.176
3.

Solutions
Courts should consider assigning supervised visitation only in
cases where it would be healthy for the child to continue to have
contact with the batterer. In cases where the batterer has a history of
using manipulation or emotional abuse, child-parent conversations
must be actively monitored by a trained supervisor. Courts should
receive status updates on how supervised visitation is going and not
hesitate to end visitation if the batterer behaves inappropriately.
Supervised visitation centers must ensure their facilities and
parking lots are safe for domestic violence victims and their children. Extra security guards should be stationed in the parking lots
when domestic violence victims will be dropping off their children.
Visitation centers also must take care to ensure a batterer is not
able to follow a victim home after pick-up at the visitation center.

[Vol. 24.41

For many families, court-ordered child support is an important tool to help families stay financially stable after divorce. But
in domestic violence cases, child support payment disputes can
give batterers another opportunity to try to exert control over
their victims.177
Many victims, out of fear of the batterer, are afraid to file
for the child support that their children need. One victim said that
going after child support from her batterer “would be like poking a
stick at a snake.”178 Many women report lowering or waiving their
requests for child support because they feared further physical violence.179 Research on child support awards indicates that the more
fear a mother has of the father, the lower the child support award
will be.180 After an initial award of a low amount of child support,
many women are afraid to return to court to ask for an increase,
even if their children’s needs have increased since the award.181
Batterers may use child support disputes as a bargaining chip
in their divorce arguments with their victims. Batterers often focus
on the balance between child support and custody.182 When a father
takes on a larger share of the custody, often his child support obligation is reduced.183 Some batterers may petition the court for custody, even though they do not want custody. They do so solely in order
to reduce their child support payments.184 These custody requests
often make victims afraid for their children’s safety, and may make
victims more likely to acquiesce on other demands.185 Some batterers may even ask for custody specifically to retaliate against the
mother, because she requested child support.186
A batterer may also use child support obligations as an excuse
to stay very involved in the victim’s life.187 Some batterers may feel
that paying support gives them a right to dictate how the victim
should live.188 Batterers may ask the children questions about the

victim’s lifestyle, in order to look for reasons to bring her back to
court for a proceeding seeking a reduction in child support.189
Even when mothers do file child support claims against batterers and win, the batterers often fail to pay.190 According to some
research, batterers are more likely than non-batterers to fail to pay
child support.191 Batterers may lie to the court about their income or
move from job to job frequently to avoid being forced to pay child
support.192 Denying child support to victims is a form of economic
abuse that leaves the victims without the means they need to take
care of their children.193 Some victims have reported that batterers
use this form of financial abuse as a revenge tactic.194 Batterers may
know that in order for child support awards to be enforced, “on a
practical level, women are required to initiate proceedings first to
locate the father and then to seek legal redress.”195 Many victims
may be afraid to push the batterer to pay child support, out of fear
that he may physically harm them or otherwise retaliate.196

Solutions
Child support in cases of domestic violence requires the court
to carefully consider the appropriate amount of child support that
should be awarded. Even if the victim is requesting a low award
of child support, the court should consider the possible factors in
her decision and make an independent judgment about the appropriate award.197
When batterers fail to pay child support, the court must strictly enforce the child support obligation. Batterers may avoid paying
child support in order to prolong the court case and require the
victim to initiate further proceedings. Courts should take the first
instance of a failure to pay child support seriously and not hesitate
to find batterers in contempt of court.198

IV. Conclusion
The ease and frequency with which batterers take advantage
of the custody process to bully and abuse their victims is deeply
troubling. Family courts must take a proactive role in preventing
abuse through the legal system. Family court judges and mediators
should attend trainings on the psychological profiles of batterers
and victims, so they are more capable of identifying domestic violence histories in court or in mediation sessions. Family court judges and mediators should vigilantly watch for abuse throughout the
mediation process, and all states should allow domestic violence
victims to opt out of mediation. In litigation, judges should remain
aware of the possibility of litigation abuse, and sanction batterers
who file frivolous motions. Courts should be wary of granting custody or visitation to batterers, and if they do, courts should carefully
structure all agreements to decrease the need for contact between
the parties. When courts award child support in domestic violence
cases, judges should ensure that the batterer does in fact pay and
that victims do not have to repeatedly face the batterer to enforce
payment. Steps like these will help family courts ensure greater
access, fairer outcomes, and increased safety for victims of domestic
violence and their children.
