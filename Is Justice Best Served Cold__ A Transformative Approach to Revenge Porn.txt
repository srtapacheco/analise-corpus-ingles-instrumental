IS JUSTICE BEST SERVED COLD?:
A Transformative Approach to Revenge Porn

Ashlee Hamilton
Abstract
People often use retributive and utilitarian concepts to argue
that we should throw people in jail for sharing nudes without the
permission of the person depicted. But it turns out that imprisoning
people is not the best approach. Revenge porn, the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, is not an individual problem. It is a
sign that something is wrong with our society. There are revenge
porn criminal statutes in about thirty-four states and the District
of Columbia, but many of them are ineffective due to limitations
imposed by the First Amendment. Thus, many scholars advocate
for this to be a federal crime. Criminalization within our current
criminal justice system, while convenient, is not the best approach
partly because prison makes most people worse off than they were
when they came. Furthermore, the United States is over-incarcerated and should find better ways to deal with crimes like revenge
porn. A transformative justice approach, which attempts to work
outside of the criminal justice system to achieve meaningful remedies for survivors and meaningful punishments for offenders, is
our best bet.

Introduction
Be honest, do you think it’s possible that a nude picture of
you could get posted without your consent? What if your grandma
called you and told you she just saw that same picture on her Facebook feed? And then your boss calls you into his office, informing
you that it’s on the company’s Facebook page as well. What’s your
first move? Call the police? Contact Facebook? Get a lawyer?
Despite your best efforts to get the image removed, the likelihood
of your success is low. The internet is expansive. You don’t know
how long the image has been online. You don’t know who posted
it or where it originated. Worst of all, you have no way of knowing who has already downloaded it or how many times they’ve
reposted it.1
Revenge porn2 is an indiscriminating beast. It does not care
whether you took the picture yourself. It does not even care whether you shared it with only one person, or just had it sitting in a
secret folder on your computer. The results are equally painful.
What hurts most is the lack of meaningful 3 remedies available once
this does happen. From tort to copyright law, the legal community
has been struggling with how to tame the problem of revenge porn.
Some states have enacted specific criminal statutes, while others
fail to acknowledge the problem at all. Some survivors have been
able to successfully recover from their perpetrators using existing
civil laws, while others have sued only to find themselves in bankruptcy court to try to get the judgment enforced.4 When all is said
and done, however, the problem—which is a societal one—remains
inadequately addressed. Imprisoning the perpetrator does not help
the survivor cope with feelings of humiliation, shame, and embarrassment. Incarceration also does not incentivize the offender—or

Roughly four percent of U.S. internet users (10.4 million people) have
either been victims of revenge porn or have been threatened with it. See Hayley Tsukayama, Facebook Takes New Steps to Stop ‘Revenge Porn’ Images from
Spreading, Wash. Post: The Switch (Apr. 5, 2017, 10:56 AM), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/05/facebook-takes-new-steps-tostop-revenge-porn-images-from-spreading/?utm_term=.8081ae1fe226 [https://

Although nonconsensual image sharing is a more precise way to describe this harm due to the many ways it can manifest itself, I use “revenge
porn” throughout this Comment for concision and simplicity’s sake.
3
When I say “meaningful,” I mean remedies that actually address and
attempt to repair the harm, the cause of the harm, and try prevent it from reoccurring. When using transformative practices, the survivor of the harm should
have a say in which types of remedies are considered meaningful.

the community—to think deeply about why this harm occurred and
how to prevent it in the future. Moreover, no amount of money won
in a civil suit will erase those images from grandma’s mind. Nor can
money repair a reputation, deter future offenders (especially insolvent ones), or restore feelings of autonomy and self-worth.
Transformative justice, while also unable to promise any of
those things, offers a more thoughtful, nuanced approach to revenge
porn. More radical than its restorative justice cousin, transformative justice recognizes that the conditions that led to the harm need
repair (not restoration), and seeks humane ways to address the
harm. Working with the survivor, the perpetrator, or both, transformative justice seeks to stop violence and prevent future harm
by working outside of the criminal justice system, which is inherently violent.5
This Comment argues that transformative justice, as opposed
to traditional retributive and restorative justice approaches, is
the best way to address revenge porn. Retributive approaches to
revenge porn do not consider the needs of the survivor. Retributive
approaches also mischaracterize the harm as an individual issue,
and fail to rehabilitate the offender. While a restorative justice
approach shifts the focus from punishing the offender to repairing and restoring the survivor, offender, and the community, it
fails to address the harmful conditions that led to the problematic behavior. Transformative justice offers a more comprehensive
5
This Comment’s assertion that transformative justice is a better approach to revenge porn is premised on the idea that prisons are an inherently
violent form of punishment incapable of providing meaningful punishment to
offenders and remedies to survivors. Although the need for prison reform is a
fascinating and controversial topic, it is beyond the scope of this Comment and,
because of its limited scope, I have tried to limit discussions about prisons to
only what is necessary for making my point about transformative justice. By
asserting that the criminal justice system is inherently violent, I mean that the
act of depriving a person of liberty is violent, and the way the criminal justice
system is run in this country—including prisons—is violent. See generally, Sharon Dolovich, Two Models of the Prison: Accidental Humanity and Hypermasculinity in the L.A. County Jail, 102 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 965, 1100 (2012)
(“[T]he notion that prisons are sites of predation and abuse because prisoners
are inherently violent lets the institutions themselves off the hook too easily.”);

approach to revenge porn that emphasizes accountability and holistic problem-solving.6
Part I introduces revenge porn by examining both the typical
and atypical scenarios in which the dissemination of intimate images might occur. It then describes the process through which many
survivors try to repair the harm, only to run into several roadblocks
that complicate or otherwise impede their access to justice. Part II
overviews scholarly proposals for dealing with revenge porn, briefly acknowledging the complications of each to demonstrate the
nuanced nature of the roadblocks mentioned in Part I. Part III suggests that if we must criminalize revenge porn, the most productive
way to do so is to operate from a transformative justice framework.
This may seem antithetical, given transformative justice’s insistence
on operating outside of the state-imposed criminal justice system. However, not all communities and survivors of revenge porn
will accept the transformative justice framework, so it is useful to
have another level of accountability in place. Part IV acknowledges the unlikeliness of addressing revenge porn completely outside
of criminal law, yet makes transformative justice a more concrete
suggestion by applying it to both typical and atypical revenge pornography scenarios.

I.

Background and Framing of Revenge Porn

Despite its pervasiveness, revenge porn continues to be an
issue that the legal world has not quite been able to pin down.
The unwieldy nature of this behavior is reflected in the roadblocks
survivors continue to face and the lack of meaningful remedies
available to them. Subpart I.A formally defines revenge porn and
provides both typical and atypical scenarios in which this harm
might occur. Subpart I.B then introduces some of the many complications survivors of revenge porn face as they try to restore their
reputation, financial resources, and humanity. Finally, Subpart I.C
briefly defines transformative justice and highlights the potential
of a transformative justice framework to provide survivors with
meaningful remedies and offenders with meaningful punishment to
avoid the violence of state-imposed criminal justice.
A.

The typical revenge porn scenario is when an ex-lover—usually a man7—gets revenge by publicizing or posting intimate pictures

or videos of a former lover without the former lover’s permission.8
Sometimes the intimate media is accompanied by personal information, such as residential addresses,9 email addresses,10 and links
to other social media accounts.11 The exchange of images during the
intimate relationship is usually accompanied by an explicit verbal
agreement or mutual tacit understanding that they would be kept
private.12 This promise is later broken when one lover becomes
upset or the relationship ends. The depicted lover is either warned
that the images will be disseminated, or threatened with their dissemination if certain conditions are not met.13 Other times, the
survivor has no idea that the images have been exposed until they
find out from an acquaintance, friend,14 or family member.
Not all revenge porn involves vehement ex-lovers.15 Atypical scenarios are often ignored, probably because they are not fully
captured by the popular term “revenge porn.” To adequately and
holistically address this harm, though, it is important to keep the
atypical ways in which it may manifest itself in mind. One way
images are shared without consent is through hacking of electronic
devices.16 Other times, the images are taken without the survivor’s
exes are men, and the victims are mostly women under 30, although pensioners
and middle-aged women have also been victims.”).

knowledge and consent during intimate acts or during rape.17 In
extortion-type scenarios, the offender takes the images unlawfully,
then threatens to disseminate them if the survivor does not engage
in sexual or other acts.
Whether typical or atypical, the existence and persistence of
revenge porn is evidence of a larger issue. In what ways does the
structure of our society contribute to this type of harm? Why are
the survivors mostly women?18 Why are LGBT survivors disproportionately represented in revenge porn cases or threats of such
conduct?19 From the way we raise our children to the way we punish human beings, many of us have in some way or another bought
in to the culture of violence, male dominance and female objectification that produces and perpetuates revenge porn and gendered
forms of violence.

But Why Did You Even Take Those Pictures?

Victim-blaming20 is, arguably, the most destructive of these
hurdles because of its potential to silence and immobilize survivors
of revenge porn. Victim-blaming has many faces. The assertion
that the person depicted in the image should not have sent the pictures in the first place is the most recognizable culprit.21 Another
iteration of this blames the survivor for even creating the intimate
image. A subtler form of victim-blaming is the well-intentioned

advice to “be careful” when sharing these images.22 These contentions fault the survivor for exercising her sexual autonomy and
expression. This thinking is part of the reason survivors are “often
reluctant, or ashamed, to come forward.”23 By shifting the focus
from the inappropriate and unwanted behavior of the offender to
the actions of the survivor, this reasoning perpetuates hegemonic
masculinity,24 misogyny,25 and hatred of women’s bodies.26 It also
sends the message that the survivor deserved the consequences and
that the perpetrator rightfully disseminated the intimate media,
thus further promoting objectification of the female body.27 Victim-blaming in general limits the conversation by framing revenge
porn as an avoidable issue, if only the survivor had not exercised
her sexual autonomy and rights to speech and expression. This
framing visualizes the problem as one of individual scope, rather

than as a societal problem28 worthy of being addressed holistically. It also generally ignores the atypical scenarios of this harm by
focusing on the perceived wrongful or immoral acts of the survivor
instead of the clear violations of privacy.29
2.

Should I Tell the Police?

Simply reporting this behavior to law enforcement personnel
is probably not the survivor’s best course of action.30 Police officers
often do not take reports of revenge porn seriously. They sometimes have a lack of understanding of the legal remedies available
to survivors,31 and thus fail to input the energy required to investigate these harms. Individual law enforcement personnel may also
not take reports of revenge porn seriously because of their own
conscious or subconscious victim-blaming mentality.

Shouldn’t I Sue the Website Too?

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA)
makes it difficult for survivors to recover damages from web hosts
in revenge porn cases.32 First passed in 1996 to protect freedom
of expression and innovation on the internet, it provides immunity from liability for many providers who publish information

posted by users. Some survivors attempt to sue the web hosts to
avoid the issue of insolvent individual offenders, and to hold the
web host accountable for its behavior in the spreading of the images.33 By granting immunity to web hosts under certain conditions,34
the CDA makes it practically impossible to recover from the web
host who allowed the offender to post the intimate content. This
shifts the conversation about accountability from those who likely
have the most power to prevent the spread of revenge porn to those
most powerless. By not holding web hosts accountable, legislatures
reinforce the idea that this is an individual, not a societal problem.35
4.

I Didn’t Intend to Cause Distress; I Just Wanted to
Make Some Money

Intent requirements of state-enacted revenge porn laws
make it nearly impossible for survivors to recover under statutes
designed specifically to address revenge porn because intent is difficult to prove,36 and the offender’s intention is not always retributive
in nature.37 In efforts to protect First Amendment speech rights,
33 See, e.g., People v. Ferrer, No. 16FE019224, 2016 WL 6905743, at *1–14
(Cal. Super. Ct. Dec. 9, 2016) (granting defendant website’s demurrer because
of language in the Communications Decency Act (CDA) that “no cause of action may be brought”); GoDaddy.com, L.L.C. v. Toups, 429 S.W.3d 752 (Tex.
App. 2014) (reversing trial court’s order denying GoDaddy.com’s motion to
dismiss because GoDaddy.com was not a publisher of the contested content).
34 47 U.S.C. § 230(c) (2012). In 2018, Congress passed legislation to
amend Section 230 of the CDA to remove immunity protecting providers and
users who publish content relating to sexual exploitation of children or sex trafficking. Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,
H.R. 1865, 115th Cong. (2018). These amendments are limited to those providers who publish content related to prostitution or trafficking, not revenge porn.
35 An example of legislatures identifying something as a societal problem
worthy of remedy is child pornography. In cases of child pornography, web hosts
are held to different standards because, apparently, child survivors of the same
crime are worthier of protection than adults. See generally U.S. Dep’t Just., Child
Pornography, Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, https://www.justice.
gov/criminal-ceos/child-pornography [https://perma.cc/74EU-7ABV] (last visited Apr. 1, 2017) (characterizing child pornography as a growing problem worthy
of attention by detailing the various agencies working to combat it, such as the
High Technology Investigative Unit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, and the National Center for Missing &
Exploited Children). Yet, the long-term negative psychological consequences of
revenge porn have been described as similar to those of child pornography. See
Kamal & Newman, supra note 12, at 362.

legislatures make it difficult to show that the perpetrator meant to
cause harm to the survivor.38 Since intent requirements typically do
not include the intent to profit, many of these statutes leave a gap
in survivor protection.
5.

How Serious is Your Distress Anyway?

Serious emotional distress requirements in civil cases also bar
survivors attempting to recover damages.39 Survivors who allege
intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) encounter this
difficulty, as defendants often challenge the survivor’s claim to have
experienced serious emotional distress by accusing the survivor
of not showing enough distress to rise to the level of “serious.”40
Serious emotional distress standards rigidly require survivors to
manifest their emotional distress in specific ways, including making
it visible to others.41 This is at odds with the uniqueness of individual emotional expression, and may force survivors to act out their
distress in specific ways just to be taken seriously and have their
individual harm validated.42 Since each person has their own way
3d 814 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016) (describing Mr. Bollaert’s associated website,
ChangeMyReputation.com, where he charged victims $250–$350 to have their
intimate photographs removed from his other website, UGotPosted.com, on
which users “posted private, intimate photographs of others”).
38 See Calvert, supra note 8, at 684 (arguing that since revenge porn is
a new form of expression, states bear the burden of proving that their statutes addressing it are constitutional). Many state legislatures, when crafting
their revenge porn statutes, encounter the issue of making it narrow enough to
not infringe upon the First Amendment, which protects content-based speech.
Posting images (content) is protected, so state legislatures have to ensure that
statutes do not too severely limit the right to post images.
39 See Cecil, supra note 31, at 2529–30 (arguing that tort law has proven
inadequate in revenge porn cases because “case law requires that victims suffer
a ‘severely disabling emotional response’ or ‘unendurable’ distress”) (quoting
Smith v. Amedisys Inc., 298 F.3d 434, 450 (5th Cir. 2002) and Harris v. Jones, 380
A.2d 611, 616 (Md. 1977)).
40 See, e.g., People v. Iniguez, 202 Cal. Rptr. 3d 237, 245 (Cal. App. Dep’t
Super. Ct. 2016) (defendant arguing that there was insufficient evidence that
the plaintiff suffered any serious emotional distress).
41 See, e.g., Patel v. Hussain, 485 S.W.3d 153 (Tex. App. 2016) (explaining the need for sufficient evidence of the appellee’s mental anguish to justify
compensation); see also Gray, supra note 23 (“Women (and men) still face an
inordinate pressure to appear as ‘perfect victims’ if they make their experiences
public and want to be believed.”).

The Potential of Transformative Justice to Provide
Meaningful Remedies and Punishment

Even when survivors of revenge porn are successful in civil
lawsuits and criminal prosecutions, there is a lack of meaningful
remedies available.43 What survivors of revenge porn want most is
a seemingly impossible-to-achieve remedy44—removal of the intimate media.45
Imprisonment of the offender can fulfill the perceived retributive needs of society and the survivor, but incarceration tends
to produce more harm than good the way it currently functions.46

prison system is not helpful in rehabilitating the offender because
prisons are inherently violent and do not teach offenders effective
ways to deal with the emotions that led to the harm in the first
place.47 Imprisonment also does not address the larger societal
problems that lead to and support revenge porn, such as misogyny,
male hegemony, and female objectification. In fact, it perpetuates
these societal ills.48
Monetary damages are available to some survivors who can
afford to sue their offenders, but others typically have neither the
resources to sue nor the knowledge of where to go or who to talk
to about initiating a lawsuit. Even when survivors are awarded
monetary damages, the offender may be insolvent or may file for
bankruptcy.49 In the best-case scenario, a survivor sues and wins a
large amount of money, which the offender can and does pay. However, any awarded money still fails to mitigate all types of damage.50

II.

The Untamable Beast

Legal scholars and practitioners have tried to address involuntary pornography in a variety of ways that include using both
civil and criminal laws. Only thirty-four states and the District of
Columbia have laws specifically addressing revenge porn.51 Even
in states where there are such laws, they have proven to be
47 See Schwartz & Boodell, supra note 46, at 127 (“They are usually
full of rage when they are released, and less prepared to function as citizens; the
predictable products of the monster factory.”).
48 See generally Craig Haney, The Perversions of Prison: On the Origins
of Hypermasculinity and Sexual Violence in Confinement, 48 Am. Crim. L. Rev.
121, 140 (2011) (arguing that “the perverse sexual/power dynamics that have
been created in prison (of which the threat and reality of prison rape are extreme examples) must in some way perpetuate and exacerbate sexism, misogyny, and even homophobia outside”).
49 Some bankruptcy courts have not been allowing this, but it is unclear
from the sparse case law what happens if the offender simply refuses or does
not have the money to pay. See In re White, 551 B.R. 814 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio
2016) (holding that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on her claim
that the state court’s judgment awarding her $151,123 was nondischargeable);
In re Grossman, 538 B.R. 34 (Bankr. E.D. Cal. 2015) (holding that the plaintiff’s
$25,000 judgment was sufficient to survive the debtor’s motion to dismiss when
the plaintiff claimed the judgment was nondischargeable).
50 Types of damage other than financial harm that can result from revenge porn include reputational harm and emotional trauma.

inadequate in certain scenarios.52 Some have relied on existing civil
laws, such as tort and copyright law,53 to address involuntary pornography. Others in the civil camp have proposed reforming §230
of the CDA,54 which currently holds website operators and their
Internet Service Providers generally immune from the actions of
third-party posters of offensive material.55 Some have suggested
using current criminal laws,56 or revising criminal laws to give judges discretion to punish one-time offenses.57 There are also scholars
who propose just creating new laws to deal specifically with this
type of harm due to the inadequacy of current laws.58
The current state of revenge porn law may lead some to conclude that this is an unsolvable problem. While validating those
feelings of hopelessness, this Part acknowledges the macro nature
of revenge porn, but subtly situates it as a larger scale issue. Each
Subpart briefly describes how legal practitioners and scholars have
attempted to gain control over this crime against the backdrop of
advancing technology and First Amendment concerns about speech
and expression, only to have it—and its survivors—slip through the
cracks of our legal system.
A.

Tort Law
In states where revenge porn laws are inadequate or nonexistent, lawyers have resorted to tort law claims, which works for some
but not for others. For example, some survivors have filed IIED
or defamation suits against their offenders.59 IIED claims require
52 See Salina Tariq, Comment, Revenge Porn: Free of “Charge?”, 17
SMU Sci. & Tech. L. Rev. 227 (2014) (arguing that there are deficiencies in the
legal system when it comes to revenge porn and that the remedies available to
revenge porn survivors are inadequate).
53 See Patton, supra note 29, at 425 (explaining that copyright law is a
unique way to combat revenge porn, but arguing that it is not the best solution
because it “offers limited protection only to a certain class of victims”).
54 See Cecil, supra note 31, at 2518.
55 47 U.S.C. § 230 (2012). See supra note 34.
56 See Patton, supra note 29 (arguing that enacting new laws is not the
best solution to revenge porn, but that prosecutors should charge offenders
using already-existing statutes).
57 See Tariq, supra note 52, at 251.
58 See Linkous, supra note 8, ¶ 45 (arguing that the best way to combat
revenge porn is to create a federal law criminalizing it).
59 See, e.g., People v. Iniguez, 202 Cal. Rptr. 3d 237 (Cal. App. Dep’t Super. Ct. 2016); Patel v. Hussain, 485 S.W.3d 153 (Tex. App. 2016). To successfully
sue for defamation, the plaintiff must show the following: (1) a false and defamatory statement was made concerning him/her; (2) there was an unprivileged
publication to a third party; (3) the publisher was at least negligent in publishing it; and (4) “either actionability of the statement irrespective of special
harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.” Restatement

a showing that the offender engaged in “extreme and outrageous
conduct” that “intentionally or recklessly cause[d] severe emotional harm.”60 Although some of the most egregious cases have been
successful using this type of claim, other survivors have found it
difficult to show that their particular experience was emotionally
distressful enough. Scholars who believe tort law is inadequate for
this type of harm argue that the limit of IIED claims for survivors of
revenge porn is the case law requirement that the survivor suffer a
“severely disabling emotional response” or “unendurable distress”
because it may be difficult to prove that their feelings of embarrassment and humiliation constitute severe emotional harm.61
Survivors have also attempted to sue using privacy torts,
which include: intrusion into seclusion,62 public disclosure of private facts,63 false light publicity,64 and commercial misappropriation
(Second) of Torts § 558 (Am. Law Inst. 1977).
60 See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Phys. & Emot. Harm § 46 (Am.
Law Inst. 2012) (“An actor who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional harm to another is subject to liability
for that emotional harm and, if the emotional harm causes bodily harm, also for
the bodily harm.”).
61 See, e.g., Wright v. Micro Elec., Inc., No. 274668, 2008 Mich. App. LEXIS 558, at *16 (Mich. Ct. App.), rev’d on other grounds, 752 N.W.2d 466 (Mich.
2008) (holding that the evidence raised a genuine issue of material fact as to
whether the posting of the photographs caused severe emotional distress when
the plaintiff testified that “he no longer wanted to go to work after the photograph was posted, that he became more angry as time went by, and that he was
embarrassed by the photos, and that he believed that his coworkers thought
less positively about him”); see also Cecil, supra note 31, at 2529–30. There may
also be issues with proving that the conduct was extreme enough to trigger liability. See Jessy R. Nations, Comment, Revenge Porn and Narrowing the CDA:
Litigating a Web-Based Tort in Washington, 12 Wash. J.L. Tech. & Arts 189, 193
(2017) (arguing that in certain communities, the conduct involved in revenge
porn might be offensive, but not enough to be “utterly intolerable in a civilized
community” as laid out in section 46 of the Second Restatement of Torts to
establish an IIED claim).
62 See, e.g., GoDaddy.com, L.L.C. v. Toups, 429 S.W.3d 752, 753 (Tex.
App. 9th 2014). In Texas, a successful intrusion on seclusion claim requires
an intentional and unjustified, unreasonable, or unwarranted intrusion on the
solitude of another person or her private affairs that is highly offensive to a
reasonable person. See Doe v. Mobile Video Tapes, Inc., 43 S.W.3d 40, 48 (Tex.
App. 2001).
63 A public disclosure tort requires the “(1) public disclosure (2) of a
private fact (3) which would be offensive and objectionable to the reasonable
person and (4) which is not of legitimate public concern.” Shulman v. Grp. W
Prods. Inc., 955 P.2d 469, 478 (Cal. 1998).
64 The plaintiff must show that the defendant, with knowledge of falsity
or in reckless disregard of the truth, placed the plaintiff before the public in a
false position that would have been highly offensive to a reasonable person.
See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652E (Am. Law Inst. 1977).

of name or likeness.65 Most states have some form of an invasion
of privacy statute that may apply to revenge porn suits.66 In one
case, the female plaintiff successfully brought a cause of action for
intentional invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of severe
emotional distress after her ex-husband disseminated nude photographs of her that she had taken during their marriage.67 She also
successfully defeated his defense of waiver, in which he claimed
that her consent to taking the photographs mooted her claim of
invasion of privacy.68 However, the “publication” element of the
invasion of privacy tort has proved to be a hindrance for many survivors who have difficulty proving that the defendant’s conduct
constitutes “publication.”69
Thus, tort law cannot be the answer to all revenge porn survivors. Many legal scholars and advocates believe that there are a
number of options for revenge porn survivors seeking redress in
civil courts via tort actions.70 On the contrary, some do not see tort
law as an effective method for seeking redress for this type of crime
due to the high costs associated with litigating tort lawsuits and the
lack of deterrent effect.71 Others are concerned about not only the
high costs of civil litigation, but also the high burden placed on the
survivor in these suits and the message it sends to society at large
about sexual freedom and expression.72

benefit sought to be obtained is not a pecuniary one.” Id. § 652 cmt. b.

Copyright Law

Copyright law is useful to some revenge porn survivors, but
not to all. Revenge porn survivors who took the pictures themselves
have claimed copyrights to the disseminated images and have sought
redress under this area of intellectual property law.73 Since the survivor took the picture herself, she owns the copyright in it and can send
takedown notices to the violating website under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA).74 This is particularly useful, given that
80 percent of disseminated images are “selfies.” 75 Another benefit
of copyright law in these cases is that the CDA does not necessarily
shield revenge porn sites from civil liability for federal copyright violations.76 In fact, “[S]ection 230 specifically provides that it shall have
‘[n]o effect on intellectual property law.”77 Thus, courts have generally interpreted the CDA not to grant immunity when the plaintiff
alleges violations of traditional intellectual property rights, such
as copyrights.78 However, if the operator of the revenge porn site
“responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material
that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity,” after receiving notification of the potential infringement, certain
provisions of the DCMA might absolve the operator of liability.79
One problem with using copyright law to recover statutory damages
from website operators is that the owner of the copyrighted media
73 See Linkous, supra note 8, ¶ 27.
74 Id. Prior to 1979, pornography was not protected under copyright
laws. See Tariq, supra note 52, at 238. In October of 1998, President Clinton
signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) into law “to protect
copyright holders against the growing threat of infringement brought on by
the widespread use of the [i]nternet.” See Digital Millennium Copyright Act
of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860 (1998); Tariq, supra note 52, at 238
(discussing how the act made it a crime to “circumvent a technology measure
that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work,” which can result in fines
up to $500,000 or up to five years of imprisonment).

must have registered her copyrighted images within ninety days of
the publication date.80
Although it is less costly than seeking a lawyer,81 using copyright law to file takedown notices is likely to be inadequate when
it comes to getting what the survivor wants most—to remove the
images from the internet altogether.82 Although one website operator may comply with the takedown notice and remove the image,
there is no way for the survivor to know who else has access to
the image or whether it has been downloaded and re-disseminated.
Thus, the survivor may have had the image removed from one site,
only to find that it has popped up on another site.83 Even more limiting, the copyright route is only available to survivors who took the
images themselves.84 Copyright law in general is merely a reactive
solution to this problem. Since copyright laws do not require website operators to ensure that the media posted on their forums are
not copyright-protected,85 this area of law is only useful after the
harm has already been done.86

Revenge Porn: Victims Are Taking on Websites for Posting Photos They Didn’t
Consent to, A.B.A. J. 45, 49 (2013) (explaining that registration of the copyright
within ninety days of first publication is required for statutory damages). For
survivors who simply want the images taken down, registration of the image(s)
is not necessary. See DMCA, What Is a DMCA Takedown?, DMCA (Apr. 20,

Existing Criminal Laws

Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have criminal laws directly targeting revenge porn.87 Although some of these
laws have been drafted in a way to provide the broadest possible
reach, others are seriously lacking in force.88 Arizona, for instance,
requires that the image be shared with the intent to “harm, harass,
intimidate, threaten or coerce.”89 This intent standard leaves out
the possibility of an intent to profit, or people who are just sharing
the image for entertainment.90 Another example is the California
revenge porn law, which requires that the distributor of the image
“knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause
serious emotional distress” and that the survivor actually suffers
that distress.91 When a state, such as New Jersey,92 does come close
Yorker stated: “Using copyright law to combat revenge porn is a bit like using
tax law to go after Al Capone, but copyright is one of the only restrictions that
the [i]nternet respects.” Talbot, supra note 17. Other scholars not only acknowledge the limits of copyright law, but also assert that it is inappropriate for the
crime of nonconsensual image sharing. See also Rebecca Tushnet, Performance
Anxiety: Copyright Embodied and Disembodied, 60 J. Copyright Soc’y U.S.A.
209, 238 (2013) (arguing that although sites featuring revenge porn are “reprehensible . . . , distorting copyright law is not the right solution”).

89 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-1425 (2016).

making money.” See Brown, supra note 15; see also Kamal & Newman, supra

notoriety or entertainment”).

person has consented to such disclosure.

exhibit, advertise, or offer.” Id.

to drafting a statute that might criminalize most forms of revenge
porn,93 it tends to run into First Amendment issues. If a statute regulates expression based on content, it must survive strict scrutiny
to be constitutional.94 To be constitutional under the First Amendment and survive strict scrutiny, revenge porn statutes must serve
a compelling governmental interest and only regulate as much
speech as necessary to serve that interest.95
Some scholars have proposed federal criminalization of
revenge porn.96 Others insist that there are criminal laws already
available to address the various ways in which revenge porn may
present itself.97 Rachel Patton, for instance, argues that cyberstalking and harassment laws98 “provide possible avenues for
assigning criminal responsibility, particularly in instances when the
harassment is persistent or when the poster included the survivor’s

93 Although it is written in a way that would criminalize most forms
of revenge porn, the New Jersey statute took effect “in 2004, long before the
concept of revenge porn rose to public attention.” Calvert, supra note 8, at 688.
The most up-to-date version of the New Jersey statute reads:
An actor commits a crime of the third degree if, knowing that he
is not licensed or privileged to do so, he discloses any photograph,
film, videotape, recording or any other reproduction of the image, taken in violation of subsection b. of this section, of: (1) another person who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or
sexual contact; (2) another person whose intimate parts are exposed; or (3) another person’s undergarment-clad intimate parts,

Modification of the CDA § 230

Section 230 protects websites from liability arising out of
posts from their users;102 websites have two defenses available
under Section 230.103 First, if the website operator did not create
the content in question, it is protected from liability as publishers
of content posted by their users.104 Second, website operators are
protected from liability if they made a good faith effort to remove
or restrict access to “material that the provider considers obscene,
lewd, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.”105 Criminal liability
for the above actions is not covered by Section 230.106 Some argue
that the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should
be modified107 to require removal of alleged copyright violations
and content claimed to be distributed without the consent of the

103 The CDA distinguishes between two kinds of websites: service providers and information content providers. Service providers merely host the
content of third-party users. Information content providers have a role in creation or development of the content. Immunity does not apply if the ISP is also
an information content provider. § 230(f)(3).

image’s subject.108 Without such amendments, revenge porn survivors are typically unable to obtain monetary compensation from
website operators.109
Modification of Section 230 may be of little use though
because monetary compensation is often not the priority of revenge
porn survivors.110 Survivors are most concerned with the reputational and safety consequences that result from publication of the
images.111 Furthermore, modification of Section 230 alone does not
address the larger societal issues that lead to these crimes in the
first place, such as male dominance and objectification of women’s
bodies. It does not help us understand why—as a society—we have
learned to turn the naked human body into a source of shame. It
does not explain how and why we have raised men who mask their
pain by displaying sexual violence toward others. Thus, although
modification of Section 230 may allow for temporary relief for certain survivors, it cannot be applied in isolation because it will fail to
prevent the harm from happening again.

Federal Criminalization

Scholars who advocate for federal criminalization of revenge
porn emphasize the inefficiency of existing civil remedies.112 Federal criminalization would protect survivors whose states fail to pass
adequate revenge porn laws.113 It would also address the trivial108 Tariq, supra note 52, at 257.
109 See Linkous, supra note 8, ¶ 26; see also Patton, supra note 29, at

ization of revenge porn by law enforcement, sending the message
that this is a serious crime that “deserves attention.”114 Reforming
the CDA would not be necessary because “a federal statute criminalizing revenge porn would prevent revenge porn websites from
hiding behind the shield of liability provided by [Section] 230 of the
CDA.”115 Proponents of federal criminalization further argue that
it is likely to deter future offenders because “if a person knows he
could potentially face jail time or a heavy fine, he likely would not
be as quick to engage in such an activity.”116
In fact, some steps have already been taken in the direction of
federal criminalization. The Congresswoman for California’s 14th
congressional district, Jackie Speier, introduced the Intimate Privacy Protection Act in 2016.117 Offenders of this bill “would face fines
and up to five years in prison whether the images were shared by
a jilted ex-lover . . . or by those seeking to profit . . . .”118 The bill
states, in part, “it is unlawful to knowingly distribute a private, visual depiction of a person’s intimate parts or of a person engaging
in sexually explicit conduct, with reckless disregard for the person’s lack of consent to the distribution, and for other purposes.”119
The proposed bill has received some backlash from the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has expressed concerns that
it is too broad and will potentially lead to “infringements of First
Amendment rights or the prosecution of situations that the law
was not intended to prevent.”120 But beyond its potential to conflict
with the Constitution, is this what we really want?
Those against federal criminalization of revenge porn are less
concerned with First Amendment issues121 and more concerned
about over-criminalization.122 As the most incarcerated nation

The Need for Meaningful Remedies
Revenge porn is not merely a “bad apple” problem.124 On the
contrary, it has been described as “a contemporary phenomenon
that is part of a long line of practices used to repress women.”125
From this perspective, revenge porn is not a new problem, but a
more modern way of reinforcing male dominance and objectification of women and their sexuality.126 It is also not confined to the
United States.127 Advanced technology allows a user to post media
on almost any platform, making revenge porn a global issue because
although the images may disappear in one country, they can be
downloaded and appropriated in another country.128 Because of its
global nature and patriarchal roots, combating revenge porn must
involve various stakeholders and a creative approach to accountability. Thus, mere criminalization of revenge porn cannot be an

of the naked body, which means the issue can be tackled from many other
directions.”).
125 PenzeyMoog, supra note 24, at 12.
126 Id. PenzeyMoog argues that although revenge porn is a modern
manifestation of a typical issue, it has some elements that make it particularly
unique: “(1) the public display and sharing of women/women’s sexuality, (2)
the overt unwillingness of the female participants, (3) the authenticity of that
unwillingness and 4) the crafted narrative of the revenge porn story.” Id.

adequate long term solution partly because it does nothing to
address its causes.129 In trying to address this problem, some questions we should ask are: What societal and cultural conditions led to
this type of harm?130 What individual circumstances led to this type
of harm? What do survivors of revenge porn want and need most?
How can we hold offenders accountable while also sending the
message that revenge porn is serious and will not be tolerated?131
B.

Restorative Justice is Not Enough

Restorative justice seeks to “restore intimate relationships
and community bonds that have been damaged by interpersonal
violence, through practices of community dialog and appeals to collective values.”132 Although beneficial, restorative justice133 is not
the best way to address revenge porn because it involves restoring
the offender (and perhaps the community) to an already problematic status quo.134 One facet of restorative justice is its focus on the
129 See id. (“[W]hile states’ efforts to criminalize conduct involved in the
posting of revenge porn are a step in the right direction, criminalization does
not provide a full answer to liability.”); see also Sheila A. Bedi, Seeking Transformative Justice in Ferguson, Dearborn, and Beyond, Huffington Post: The
Blog (Sept. 3, 2014, 12:07 PM), http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheila-a-bedi/
seeking-transformative_b_5755076.html [https://perma.cc/53PG-59JU] (“[A]
criminal prosecution is not about justice, healing or repairing harm. And it’s
certainly not about preventing such harm from re-occurring in the future.”).
While this Comment does not assert that criminalization of revenge porn is “a
step in the right direction,” it does acknowledge that criminal laws can be used
as leverage during transformative processes. See infra, Part IV.C.
130 See Howard Zehr, Restorative or Transformative Justice?, E. Mennonite U.: Zehr Inst. of Restorative Just. (Mar. 10, 2011), http://emu.edu/now/

133 Per Howard Zehr, restorative justice advocates would ask the following questions in preparing to address the harm: “Who has been hurt & what
are their needs? Who is obligated to address these needs? Who has a ‘stake’ in
this situation & what is the process to involve them in making things right and
preventing future occurrences?” Zehr, supra note 130.

harm to the survivor, the community, and the offender, as opposed
to the current retributive state system that pays little attention to
the survivor.135 It also validates the humanity of the offender,136
which can lead to community benefits and education during the
phase in which remedies are crafted. Restorative justice tries to
avoid the violence of prison and state punishment by facilitating
meaningful conversation between the survivor and offender.137
Two drawbacks of restorative justice are the state’s involvement and the issue of restoring stakeholders to conditions that were
already problematic. Involving the state in restorative processes
is counterproductive when the state employs violence against the
offenders throughout their punishment, thus disabling them from
changing their mindsets and behavior for the better.138 This involves
a larger issue with the way prisons are run—which is beyond the
scope of this Comment—and should be addressed by a more comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system.139 Another issue
with restorative justice is that the offender will be remanded back
to the current retributive criminal justice route if mediation fails,
the offender refuses to cooperate, or the offender fails to complete
his side of the bargain.140 Thus, revenge porn offenders who choose
to go the restorative justice route may find themselves worse off in
restorative processes such as Victim Offender Mediation.141 If, for
example, the offender takes a more active role in the restorative
justice process and chooses not to be completely at the mercy of

the victim,142 he may find himself in court anyway. What the offender said in mediation is often used in the subsequent criminal trial,143
which is offensive to the process and generally unfair because many
cooperate with the understanding that what they say during the
process will be kept confidential.144 Transformative justice avoids
this problem by operating separately from state systems.

Two Wrongs Don’t Make a Right: Loosening Our Grip on
Retribution

In the United States, the current criminal justice system alone
is not the best way to address revenge porn because it primarily
encourages and reinforces violence,145 and does not address the root
causes of the issue.146
Imprisoning revenge porn offenders will probably make their
antisocial behavior worse than it was before they entered prison.147
The violence of imprisonment causes significant stress to prisoners, which leads to impaired brain development, lower adaptability,
142 See Delgado, supra note 134, at 760 (“VOM gives great power to the
victim, and mediators and judges reinforce that power, placing defendants in an
almost powerless position.”).

experienced in their families, in their personal relationships, and in the state
institutions that shape their day-to-day lives.”); see also Bedi, supra note 129
(arguing that “criminal prosecution is not about justice, healing or repairing
harm”); Delgado, supra note 134, at 771 (describing the traditional criminal justice system as worse than restorative justice and the Victim Offender Mediation
approach because “as a result of a slow evolution, our criminal justice system
has emerged as perhaps the most inegalitarian and racist structure in society”).
146 Since the criminal justice system is the primary method of addressing
societal harms, it may be a good legal backdrop to have until the system can be
sufficiently reformed.

and even higher stress levels.148 Many people who commit crimes
against other people have been shown to have deficient amygdalae,149 which can lead to a lack of empathy, among other issues.150 This
may make it harder for people with deficient amygdalae to change
their behavior. Studies of the brain imply that the brain is capable
of change under the right conditions.151 Thus, although everyone
with a properly functioning amygdala is capable of changing their
behavior, the cycle of violence and stress caused by modern imprisonment impairs the brain’s ability to positively change by damaging
the amygdala.152 Since imprisonment can further damage people’s
amygdalae—in turn impairing their ability to feel empathy—it can
potentially make it harder for prisoners to resist recidivism.
To hold offenders and others indirectly involved accountable
while still respecting the offender’s humanity, we need to let go of
outdated and ineffective retributive defaults. I am not advocating
for a complete abolition of the prison system. I am arguing that it is
not working.153 But since addressing that issue requires many years
of reforming mindsets and systems, I propose an expansion of the
options available to survivors of revenge porn to provide relief to
those whose cases do not fit neatly into the laws currently available,
and to those who seek more meaningful remedies. To be open to
other approaches, we need to change the way we think about people
who commit crimes. This requires embracing innovative, meaningful,

and forward-looking alternatives. Of course, it also involves rejecting methods that merely perpetuate harm and violence.
D.

Transformative Justice is Particularly Appropriate for This
Type of Harm

Transformative justice is “a liberatory approach to violence”
that seeks to achieve safety and accountability without relying on
a state’s punishment system and other forms of violence.154 The
principles of transformative justice offer a more comprehensive
approach to addressing violent crimes155 like revenge porn. Beyond
simply restoring those involved in the harm to the conditions prior
to the harm, transformative justice is concerned with “providing
victims with answers for why they were victimized, recognizing the
wrong that has occurred, providing restitution, and restoring/establishing peace and security.”156 Generation FIVE—an organization
dedicated to combatting child sexual abuse—has articulated seven
principles157 of transformative justice to combat child sexual abuse,
which is undoubtedly a more egregious crime than revenge porn.158
For concision’s sake, this Comment will focus on the first four of
these principles and their applicability to revenge porn: liberation,
shifting power, safety, and accountability.159
The liberation principle expands the notion of who is responsible for the harm. It involves methods of attaining justice that
“challenge [s]tate and systemic violence rather than attempting to
reform or re-direct it.”160 The goal behind this principle is to build

the ability of “organizations, communities, and intimate networks
to respond to the needs of individuals and relationships within a
broader liberation politic.”161 In the revenge porn context, this
would involve a re-articulation of who is responsible for the offensive behavior. The current rhetoric around this question is centered
around the survivor—for taking the intimate photos in the first
place—and the offender for disseminating them.162 Expanding the
notion of who is responsible means extending the definitive group
outward from the individual to the larger society. Revenge porn
continues to flourish because our communities allow it to persist.
Victim-blaming and limited articulations of who is at fault legitimize
male dominance and female objectification. The way legislatures
respond to this harm also sends messages about its importance.163
For example, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act tells
us that internet service providers are not responsible for this harm.
Intent requirements in state legislation send the message that we
only punish those who we can prove had the express purpose to
cause harm. These iterations of fault are problematic because they
ignore the societal context in which this harm occurs.
The aim of the next principle is to shift power “away from
those individuals, community institutions and systems that aim to
maintain oppression toward individuals, collectives, and community
and alternative institutions that promote [t]ransformative [j]ustice
and liberation.”164 Identifying those responsible for revenge porn
is a necessary preliminary step to shifting power away from those
individuals and institutions invested in maintaining the status quo.
In the context of revenge porn, any person or entity who has a
stake in maintaining male hegemony, body shaming, female objectification, and other systems that have contributed to the revenge
porn epidemic are those from whom we need to shift power. This
also requires digging deeper into our cultural values that may be
problematic.

The principle of safety is an important feature of addressing
the harm that survivors of revenge porn face. Conversations about
safety must include acknowledgement of the unique reputational
harms165 that come with revenge porn, as well as of the physical and
emotional difficulties. Since offenders make a habit of linking the
intimate media to other social media accounts along with personal addresses and telephone numbers,166 it is imperative to address
the physical safety of survivors. At the individual level, emotional safety can be in the form of encouraging community members
to refrain from comments and actions that make the survivor feel
worse. This would also include the offender taking down all images within his or her control. Reputational safety can be achieved in
a variety of ways, such as educating employers on how to exercise
empathy and not firing employees upon discovering that their intimate media has been disseminated. Smaller communities can work
together to protect one another (e.g., family members, children, students, etc.) from disseminated images. On a larger scale, action can
be taken across communities and collectives to prevent the spread
of unauthorized intimate images.
The principle of accountability has six aspects167 that focus on
a willingness to disrupt problematic behaviors and dynamics, thus
supporting the process of transformation.168 Acknowledging the
harmful nature of revenge porn rebuts the mainstream focus on
intent, instead highlighting its negative impacts. This involves viewing the crime not as an isolated event, but as a manifestation of a
larger problem. Making appropriate reparations for this harm169 is
arguably the most challenging of the six aspects of accountability
165 Dierickx, supra note 7, at 59 (“Mainly women are losing jobs and income and reputations because of this kind of abuse.”).
166 See Goldnick, supra note 128, at 585–86 (2015) (“Termed ‘revenge
porn,’ these postings are often accompanied by offensive and personal remarks
about the subject, and some of the posters link to the illicit images the subject’s . . . personal information, such as the subject’s full name, address, telephone number, place of employment, and other detailed information . . . .”).
167 These aspects are: 1) Acknowledging the harm, even if it is unintended; 2) acknowledging its negative impact on individuals and the community; 3)
making appropriate reparations for the harm to individuals and the community;
4) transforming attitudes and behaviors to prevent future violence and contribute toward liberation; 5) engaging bystanders to hold individuals accountable,
and toward shifting community institutions and conditions that perpetuation
and allow violence; and 6) building movements that can shift social conditions
to prevent further harm and promote liberation, including holding the State accountable for the violence it perpetuates and condones. See Generation FIVE,

because once an image is posted, it can be reposted. Scholars’ ideas
about how to remedy this harm, which include monetary damages,
modification of current laws, and criminalization with imprisonment and fines,170 do not target the root of the problem, which is
a society that values female objectification,171 stigmatization of the
naked body,172 and male dominance.173 Our institutions and systems
of punishment reinforce those same values.
Accountability also requires a change in attitudes and behaviors.174 This is a large-scale endeavor that requires engaging various
aspects of how we develop and function in society—from the way
we teach children in schools to the intimate structures and dynamics of our families.175 In addition to addressing the ways in which we
socialize children, we must invent creative ways to engage bystanders to hold other individuals accountable.176 People need to feel
obligated to speak up when they recognize that this harm is happening. That requires them to understand that it is wrong and to
feel safe saying or doing something about it.177 Lastly, we must build
movements around the issue of revenge porn to prevent further
harm and promote liberation from state and other systems of violence that do not serve to eliminate and prevent such conduct.

There are several philosophies of punishment that try to justify state-inflicted punishment, most notably general (and specific)
deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and last but not least, retribution. The appeal of each philosophy of punishment changes
as we as a society change, and hopefully evolve. Unfortunately,

retribution has been appealed to more and more to try and justify America’s criminal justice system.178 Indeed, at times it may be
so entrenched in our society that it makes it extremely difficult for
some to imagine another way of addressing such a heinous crime
as revenge porn.179 Yet, hopefully most can acknowledge that our
current criminal justice system should not aim solely—or even primarily—for retributivist ideals.180 This Subpart identifies some
concerns traditional philosophy of punishment advocates might
have with transformative justice as an alternative process to the
criminal justice system. It then attempts to address and alleviate
those concerns.
Some may view revenge porn as too massive to be tamed by
transformative justice. Unlike child sexual abuse, it would involve
much more than mobilization of communities in the United States
because it can so rapidly spread across the internet, which is global. Since intimate media can appear and reappear anywhere in
the world, there needs to be a much more serious and immediate response. Yes, revenge porn is unique given the internet’s role
making it transnationally available. But every country with internet access has a stake in stopping revenge porn. Therefore, this is
an opportunity for multiple countries to unite to combat a global problem. This is not as far-fetched as it may seem, as nations
have come together numerous times throughout history to solve a
shared problem.181
178 Retribution can have different meanings depending on who is using
the term and the context within which it is being used. See generally John Cottingham, Varieties of Retribution, 29 Phil. Q. 238 (1979) (explaining nine different approaches to punishment, all of which have been labeled as retributive).
Retribution has not always been the primary justification for our criminal justice system. See David Dolinko, Some Thoughts About Retributivism, 101 Ethics 537, 537 (1991). As used in this Comment, retributivism refers to the idea
that people who commit crimes need to be punished, and that the punishment
should be proportionate to the crime. See Don E. Scheid, Kant’s Retributivism,
93 Ethics 262, 262–63 (1983).
179 See Generation FIVE, supra note 132, at 41 (explaining that “communities often struggle to come up with transformative responses to violence
or even responses that are less repressive and violent that those of the State.”).
180 See Dolinko, supra note 178, for a powerful critique of several forms
of retributivism, although refuting retributivism is outside the scope of this

Those skeptical of rehabilitation may contend that criminals
do not change, so why should we put our energy toward treating
them as if they do? This defeatist argument unfortunately reflects
a lack of faith in humanity and is inherently incompatible with any
meaningful form of criminal justice. It implies that the only productive way to address egregious criminal activity is to incapacitate
criminal actors. Daniel Reisel argues that productive punishment
should include ways to get people who commit serious crimes to
change their brains and behavior for everyone’s benefit.182 The
current prison system in this country is unproductive; it generally
does not include meaningful ways to help those who commit crimes
change their behavior.183 Moreover, the way people who commit
crimes are treated in prison tends to cause or worsen psychological
issues.184 When, if ever, they are released from prison, offenders are
worse than they were before they went and more likely to recidivate.185 Unfortunately, the putative process of rehabilitation has
not been effective at reintegrating into society those who have been
in prison.186 Criminals can change,187 but if we continue to punish
them unproductively, we risk further perpetuating the violence we
claim to be trying to stop.

(explaining how Facebook got 150 safety organizations and experts from various countries together to get feedback on its recent revenge porn policy).
182 See Reisel, supra note 148. Reisel explains that studies of an area of
the brain—called the amygdala—suggest that criminals are capable of extraordinary change under the right conditions.
183 Although this assumes that a purpose of punishment should be rehabilitation, scholars disagree on the purposes of punishment. See generally Mike
C. Materni, Criminal Punishment and the Pursuit of Justice, 2 Brit. J. Am. Legal Stud. 263 (2013) (arguing that each theory of punishment is deeply flawed
and that restorative justice is the most promising path); Albert Alschuler, The
Changing Purposes of Criminal Punishment: A Retrospective on the Past Century and Some Thoughts About the Next, 70 U. Chi L. Rev. 1 (2003) (examining
the shift in objectives of punishment throughout the twentieth century).
184 See Harris, supra note 134, at 214 (“The violence of carceral institutions is not limited to threats from other inmates. Correctional officers rely on
coercion and the threat of coercion to obtain compliance. Disrespect, deliberate intrusions into privacy, and verbal abuse are often part of the correctional
officer-inmate relationship.”).

As a society, we should also change the way we think about
criminals and their ability to change. Many tend to view people
who commit crimes as defective parts of a near-perfect system. In
fact, the imperfections of the system—poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, hypersexualization, the proliferation of automatic
weapons, to name a few—make it more likely that criminal behavior will occur.188 That we as a society resort to keeping people in
cages, including life-imprisonment or even death, reflects a view
that some people are incapable of change insofar as a primary justification for our punishment system is rehabilitation.189 While it may
be true that a certain small number of individuals may be mentally
ill and incapable of change now, this does not justify the violence in
our approaches to criminal behavior.
Other skeptics of a transformative justice approach may be
concerned that offenders—and others—will not cooperate. If a
revenge porn offender is unwilling to work through transformative processes to address the problem behavior, that person can
just as easily take their chances with the current criminal justice
system. But the prevalence of revenge porn and the fact that one
in twenty-five people have been threatened with it190 suggest that
most people have a stake in addressing the problem in a more
effective way.
The double revenge argument—or that revenge begets
revenge—tells us that revenge porn survivors want offenders punished in a tangible way (i.e., with prisons and fines) for various
reasons.191 This is contrary to what most survivors have identified
as what they want most,192 but there are bound to be some who feel
a strong need to get their own revenge, believe incarceration will
change the offender, or who rely on the offender’s incarceration
to feel safe or secure. Although the survivor’s viewpoint deserves
respect and is valuable, it is not the only consideration in figuring
out how to address this harm because the survivor is not the only

any meaningful way.”).

one impacted by it. Survivors may also be overwhelmed by emotions that crave retribution because that is what momentarily feels
good after being deeply hurt by another person. This does not
necessarily mean it is a good approach. This crave for retributive
revenge may also be a manifestation of the survivor’s socialization
in a country where the default is imprisonment.193 Productive punishments need to consider future implications, not just what feels
good in the moment. Also important is the fact that imprisonment,
despite its tangibility, has not been working.194 As Angela Harris
notes, “there is no evidence that the worse we treat inmates, the better people they become.”195
Some may feel that although retributivism196 as traditionally
implemented is too harsh, transformative justice may be too soft
of an approach to this crime. People who do bad things deserve to
be punished, not coddled. While punishment may be necessary, it
should also be meaningful, humane, and productive in meeting the
goals of punishment, which include changing the unwanted behavior and preventing it from reoccurring.197 If the traditional goals
and justifications of punishment like retribution are not satisfactory, they should be changed.

IV. Assuaging Skeptics: Making the Impossible Possible
Many people are skeptical about transformative justice
because they have their own philosophies about how crime should
be handled. But some are skeptical just because it is an unfamiliar concept. More directed to the latter group of people, Subpart
IV.A offers a set of premises that are necessary to understand why
193 A political theorist, William Connolly, argues that the benefit of
retributive punishment regimes is that it gives people permission to resent
criminals. More specifically he argues that people who commit crimes are social scapegoats. See William E. Connolly, The Desire to Punish, in The Ethos
of Pluralization 41, 41–74 (1995).
194 See Harris, supra note 134, at 215 (arguing that the violence imposed
prisons and other institutions “might be merely regrettable if it ‘worked’—that
is, if it made society safer”).
195 Id.
196 Retributivism can be described as the belief that “punishment communicates respect for the criminal by recognizing him as a moral agent and
respect for the victim by avenging his harm.” Butler, supra note 46, at 1003.
197 See Joshua Dressler, Understanding Criminal Law 22–23 (3d ed.
2001) (arguing that although some utilitarian advocates argue that one of the
main goals of punishment is deterrence, those same people apply retributive
concepts when determining whether and to what degree to punish someone).
Prisons, regardless of the reasons they are used, are not working in a way that
will adequately change unwanted behavior. See supra Part III.C.

transformative justice is a better approach to revenge porn. Subpart
IV.B gives three examples of communities that use a transformative justice framework to address a community problem. Finally,
Subpart IV.C offers ideas on how communities can apply transformative justice principles to revenge porn.
A.

Three Points of Departure: Can We at Least Agree on This?
Transformative justice advocates do not seek to transform the
criminal justice system.198 Instead, the goal is “to create alternatives
to incarceration.”199 To effectively implement transformative practices, each community must determine for itself what alternatives to
criminal justice, and thus to police, are appropriate.200 This requires
a basic set of premises. First, one must believe that justice can be
achieved outside of this country’s criminal justice system.201 Since
retributivism and utilitarianism flow through many of our veins,
these entrenched ideas about punishment may require significant
transformation before one is able to advocate on behalf of survivors
and offenders within a transformative justice framework. Second,
one must accept that certain harms—such as revenge porn—are
evidence of larger problems in society as opposed to being limited
to individual acts. This premise goes to the heart of transformative justice, which recognizes that our system’s current approach to
criminal justice fails to address the conditions that shaped the perpetrator and encouraged his actions.202 Third, one must believe that
perpetrators of crime are humans who deserve to be held accountable in compassionate ways.203

the narrow actions of the individual alleged to have broken a law. Because a
prosecution is an inherently focused, individualized inquiry, the larger cultural
forces that have shaped the wrong-doer are left unaddressed. But true justice
requires that we confront these cultural forces head on. And a criminal prosecution simply can’t do that.”).

Safe OUTside the System: Violence Toward LGBT
Community

The Safe Neighborhood Campaign was launched in 2007 by
Safe OUTside the System (SOS), a queer youth of color collective based in Brooklyn, New York.204 The Campaign consisted of
three phases with the following stated goals: “empower community members to prevent violence before it starts, intervene while
violence is happening, and to build stronger relationships among
our neighbors, families, housemates, friends, intimate partners, cultural workers, small businesses, and community organizations.”205
During the first phase, SOS sought neighborhood businesses and
organizations to identify themselves as safe havens.206 The second
phase had an educational component to address the causes of antigay and anti-trans violence.207 The third phase involved recruitment
of community members and public figures into the campaign to further its stated goals.208
In its effort to further the goals of transformative justice by
making this practice accessible to various communities, SOS provides a “guide for scaling transformative justice and practices in
your community.”209

SOS has used a transformative justice framework to protect
and provide for its stakeholders. For example, three generations

to ensure safety at parties without relying on the police or state
systems.211 This twelve-page toolkit—available in English and
Spanish—encourages the party planners to create a safety plan,
which includes building teams whose members are assigned different roles in the event of an emergency (e.g., Safe Transporters,
Dispatchers, De-Escalators, etc.).212 In the event that the police
show up or need to be called, the toolkit walks the reader through
how to navigate their interaction with the police.213 It even goes
into detail about what to do if arrests are made or if there is a need
to call Emergency Medical Services.214 This is one example of how
a community can come together with a common goal and develop
tools and resources to both address and prevent further violence in
that community.

encouraging others to intervene/prevent violence from happening; and supporting survivors of violence.”

concern, opportunity, and capacity), developing a safety strategy,
supporting healing and resilience, holding accountability, working
for community transformation, and strengthening collective resistance.216 Although these practices do not have to be applied in a
specific order, they all need to be addressed.217 Moreover, most situations will require cycling through these practices multiple times
to different depths.218
While Generation FIVE maintains that their publication is
not meant to be a “how to” manual for implementing transformative justice,219 it thoroughly explains the meaning and potential
challenges of each practice. Of particular interest to skeptics might
be the “Relationship to Public Systems” section that details how
to navigate and negotiate the relationship of transformative justice
to public systems.220 More specifically, it discusses the importance
of having a clear understanding of the risks involved in leveraging public systems “as a mechanism of coercion for someone who
is unaccountable for their sexually abusive behavior.”221 Should
the choice to engage public systems be made, the collective should
have a plan with how to deal with the consequences, as well as a
continued commitment to working outside of the system “towards
healing, transformation and accountability.”222 This demonstrates
the best efforts of transformative justice advocates to work outside
of systems of violence, while also maintaining the realistic view that
sometimes it is inevitable, and other times “people will see the system as a last resort when community-based justice approaches are
not successful.”223

Philly Stands Up!: Sexual Assault

Philly Stands Up (PSU) is a collective of individuals in Philadelphia that uses a transformative justice framework “to confront

and changing behavior of perpetrators, rather than “ostracizing and

allowing future assaults elsewhere.”225 PSU is also a resource to
survivors seeking help and support.226 Aside from seeking to transform perpetrators and restore autonomy to survivors, PSU makes it
a priority to educate themselves and their communities on “issues
that contribute to sexualized violence” by hosting workshops, supporting other groups, and encouraging awareness.227
PSU acknowledges that it cannot work with every perpetrator
of sexualized violence.228 PSU typically begins to work with perpetrators through a referral or by being contacted by someone—often
a perpetrator—seeking help and resources.229 Not all situations are
handled in the same way, so it is difficult to document a step-by-step
process. Sometimes, PSU has weekly meetings with various stakeholders that includes “a personal check-in and ends with a check-out,
and . . . . a mixture of debriefing current situations and ‘tasking’
new situations.”230 Another part of its work is the empowerment
of survivors, who are often left with a feeling of “loss of power and
control over their bodies, their environment, their lives and their
community.”231 Sometimes, these feelings can lead the survivor to
no longer want the perpetrator in their community. Although PSU
does its best to “support the wishes of the survivor,” it is also committed to working with rather than punishing or criminalizing the
perpetrator in an effort to restore trust and responsibility to the
perpetrator.232 This can sometimes require PSU to serve as a buffer,
which allows it to “distinguish [itself] as a more appropriate space
for perpetrators to vent their concerns, frustrations, and perspective
while coming to terms with and understanding the implications of
their actions.”233 In this way, PSU tries to facilitate personal growth
for both the perpetrator and the survivor.234

Proposed Application to Revenge Porn

Almost all revenge porn scenarios pose unique problems
when it comes to developing and implementing a community-based
approach to address the harm. First, the untamable nature of the
internet makes it seemingly impossible to contain the harm. Second, some of the ways advocates might want to help survivors of
revenge porn, or prevent future incidents, is to advise people not to
take the intimate media in the first place. As previously explained,
this advice tends to refocus the cause of the harm to the survivor,
which has broader societal consequences.235 Third, the patchwork of
legislation that currently exists to address this harm results in inequities in the application of transformative justice, since only some
people will be able to use existing systems as leverage.236 Despite
these challenges, a transformative justice framework is the best and
most humane short and long-term solution to this type of harm.
The typical revenge porn scenario is arguably the most conducive to application of a transformative justice framework because
the perpetrator is someone the survivor knows and is likely a part of
the same community, whether that community consists of the surrounding city, school or even neighborhood. Since the community
is easier to define, it is easier for the collective to hold the perpetrator accountable. Transformative justice would also be particularly
useful in communities where there is no applicable criminal statute
or inadequate criminal statutes. However, this could pose problems because the ability to leverage public systems as a coercive
tool—a feature of the above three examples of transformative justice in operation—is not an option. Thus, in communities where
there is no legal redress available to survivors, the collective will
have to be quite creative in finding ways to effectively hold the perpetrator accountable.237
Atypical revenge porn scenarios—e.g., sextortion, hacking,
secret voyeurism, filmed sexual assault, etc.—are more likely to
have either criminal or civil laws that adequately address the harm
caused. However, there still will undoubtedly be stakeholders
235 See discussion supra Part I.B.
236 See supra Part II.
237 Generation FIVE explains the importance of leverage in planning
around accountability. More specifically, the organization notes that “influence
and pressure can be brought to bear on the person to encourage accountability.” Generation FIVE, supra note 132, at 47. Some different types of leverage
include sanctions, use of force, and resorting to public systems. Id. at 47–48.
Any plan that the collective develops to hold someone accountable should, at
minimum, include the following elements: relationship, reparations, standards,
and monitoring/review. Id. at 48.

who wish to avoid the violence of our current criminal justice system, or who cannot afford to bring a civil lawsuit. In these cases,
a transformative justice framework remains appropriate. A commonly expressed idea among transformative justice advocates is
that there is no “how to” guide on how to apply this framework in
one’s community. Instead, each community must decide for itself
how to develop and implement such practices. That is the beauty—
and challenge—of implementing transformative justice around any
given issue.
One potential application of a transformative justice framework to revenge porn can occur on university campuses.238 Students,
faculty, other university personnel, and community members
from the surrounding community can come together to identify revenge porn as a community issue they would like to address.
The group can define their specific transformative justice framework, the nature of the revenge porn problem in their community
and recruit others who are interested in combatting this issue. The
group can then share stories, strategies and lessons learned from
dealing with this problem behavior to create intervention services,
foster support, develop community safety, and imagine alternatives
to policing. At the university level, this could look like student
groups across various disciplines and levels (e.g. law school, medical school, engineering, etc.) working closely with one another
and local organizations to combat revenge porn. When developing intervention services and support, the group can partner with
counseling services, the Title IX office, and other on-campus agencies (e.g. Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion). To make their
developed approach sustainable, the group can create guides, toolkits and other resources for future generations of students and
community members.

Conclusion
As it turns out, the beast of revenge porn is tamable. However, it will require effort from all stakeholders to acknowledge the
roots of this behavior and dismantle the systems, mindsets and values that allow it to continue. Some of the necessary changes require
letting go of outdated retributive ideas about how to best serve justice, and embracing a more complex understanding of revenge porn
and the consequences of how it is addressed. Transformative justice
offers a way for various communities to tackle this problem in ways
appropriate for their specific population, while avoiding the violence of state criminal justice systems. Of course, there is no perfect
solution to solving any community harm, but there are productive
approaches to developing solutions.
