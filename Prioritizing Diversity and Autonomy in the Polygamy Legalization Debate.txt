PRIORITIZING DIVERSITY AND
AUTONOMY IN THE POLYGAMY
LEGALIZATION DEBATE
Sarah Rogozen*
Introduction
Mainstream America is fascinated with non-monogamy.1 We
fill our TV screens with the daily lives of the Sister Wives2 and
1
A wide range of non-monogamous practices and subcultures exist around
the country. This Article will address consensual, committed non-monogamous
relationships, employing the following terms.
Edward Stein defines the polyamorous as “people . . . who want to be
seriously involved sexually and romantically with more than person at
a time.” Edward Stein, Plural Marriage, Group Marriage, and Immutability in Obergefell v. Hodges and Beyond, 84 UMKC L. Rev. 871, 879
(2016). Stein identifies two types of long-term, marriage-like, polyamorous relationships: “group marriage,” in which all parties are involved
with each other, and “plural marriage,” in which an individual has multiple partners who are not involved with each other. Id. at 880. Like
Stein, I will use “polygamy” to refer to both group and plural marriages,
and whether or not those relationships have legal recognition or—as is
universally the case in the United States today—do not.
For the sake of clarity, I will sometimes distinguish between the two, using “polygamous cohabitation,” or when applicable, “religious cohabitation,” to mean the unrecognized relationships. Cf. Brown v. Buhman,
947 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1181 (D. Utah 2013), vacated as moot, Brown v.
Buhman, 822 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2016) (describing religious cohabitation as “private spiritual marriages not licensed or otherwise sanctioned by the state”) (internal quotation marks omitted). At times, I
will also use the widely understood terms “polygyny,” an arrangement
in which one man is married to multiple women, and “polyandry,” a
marriage between one woman and multiple men.
A wide range of alternative terminology exists. See, e.g., Elizabeth F.
Emens, Monogamy’s Law: Compulsory Monogamy and Polyamorous
Existence, 29 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 277, 303–09 (2004) (exploring various labelling schemes and relationship types, and noting
that when it comes to polyamory, “the sensibility of many polys rebels
against line-drawing and exclusion”).

consume a steady diet of online features on the coming poly “revolution.”3 Our Supreme Court is interested in non-monogamy, too.
During oral arguments for Obergefell v. Hodges, Justice Alito asked
counsel for the petitioners whether a finding that same-sex unions
are protected in the right to marry would require states to recognize
polygamy too.4 When the Court ruled for the same-sex litigants,
Chief Justice Roberts charged in his dissent that Obergefell may
indeed open the door to recognition for polygamous families.5 The
case has energized polygamist calls for just that6 and polygamy’s
approval rates, while not high, are rising.7 In light of these developments, this Article explores several legal and cultural aspects of
what may become the next culture war.
However, the polygamy legalization debate need not turn out
that way. Polygamy creates strange bedfellows, garnering both support8 and opposition9 from across the political spectrum. Currently,

much of the legal literature about polygamy focuses on whether
sufficient government interests justify banning it.10 This Article
proposes that the debate instead coalesce around two ideals that
a wide variety of stakeholders can embrace—the related principles
of autonomy and diversity. Our substantive due process doctrine
emphasizes the importance of creating space within our laws for
individuals to make their own decisions about personal relationships. Free exercise jurisprudence, which protects our religious
choices, does so even when a community’s practices are highly idiosyncratic or unpopular. Respect for these values should lead our
society to pursue full polygamy legalization.
Doing so will not be easy in today’s cultural climate.11 Many
people associate non-monogamous marriage with the abuses
reported in some fundamentalist Mormon communities.12 In addition, a wide variety of our laws presuppose two marital partners;
adjusting them will take some effort. Pursuing legalization alongside taking targeted steps to address these difficulties will make
our society more welcoming for the tens of thousands—perhaps
millions—of non-monogamous people13 who live and love in the
United States. Not only does this population lack access to the
government benefits that accompany civil marriage, it suffers stigma and marginalization in American society.14 Worse, many wives

reveal their relationship status. This threat disincentivizes them
from leaving their marriages and from reporting abuse.16
Remedying these injustices requires a clear-eyed look at
American polygamy, without relying on stereotypes. To that end,
Part I of this Article describes the range of American polygamous
practices and the cultures that have developed around them. Scholars and the popular press often situate polygamy in two camps—
religious and secular. Although this distinction is initially helpful to
introduce the various subcultures, I suggest it is not always meaningful when considering polygamy as a legal matter. Part II outlines
the status of polygamy in American law, and reviews recent litigation regarding plural marriage and polygamous cohabitation. Part
II also describes the legal and social effects of anti-polygamy laws
on polygamous families.
Parts III and IV discuss two paths for securing polygamy legalization—free exercise and substantive due process law. In these
sections, I consider threshold questions about reaching heightened
scrutiny, and I root my answers in the principles of diversity and
autonomy, respectively.17 In Part III, I argue that courts considering
federal constitutional free exercise claims will find many anti-polygamy laws neutral and generally applicable, but that this may not
be the case in Utah, a state whose relationship with polygamy is
intimately tied to anti-Mormon animus. In states that have Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, or provisions in their constitutions
mandating heightened scrutiny of laws that substantially burden
religion, it will be easier to reach heightened scrutiny. However,
due to the varied relationships religious polygamists have with
their faiths’ guidance on non-monogamy, anti-polygamy laws may
not substantially burden all such plaintiffs. In any case, a religious
liberty holding would encompass far from the totality of American
polygamists, so legalization will require a broader approach.
Part IV asserts that Supreme Court cases prioritizing autonomy in decision-making about personal matters, especially regarding intimate relationships and marriage, justify a finding that the
Due Process Clause demands decriminalization and recognition of
polygamy. Part IV then responds to three key counterarguments:
first, that this line of precedent is inapplicable because Obergefell
relies on an immutable sexual orientation absent from polygamy
cases; second, that polygamy is inherently abusive, and thus not

protected by Lawrence or worthy of legalization; and third, that
the constitutional discourse of autonomy does not apply to polygyny, because true consent to enter such a marriage is often, or
always, absent.
I. Polygamy in American Culture
American polygamy, often stereotyped and exoticized, is seldom treated with sufficient precision in court opinions or popular
culture. This Part surveys the variety of polygamy practices found
in the United States, arguing that the common distinction between
religious and secular polygamy is actually more ambiguous. Such a
reframing complicates free-exercise cases.
A.

Religious Polygamy
Polygamy is found in a variety of American religious communities. Most familiar to many readers will be fundamentalist Mormon sects,18 who adhere to early Mormon teachings on polygyny
no longer followed by the Church of Latter-Day Saints (“LDS
Church”).19 Polygamous fundamentalist Mormon communities are
concentrated in western states such as Utah and Arizona, as well as
in Mexico and Canada.20 While some communities are dramatically
insular, others are more integrated with secular society.21 A number

See Emens, supra note 1 at 301–02 (asserting that most Americans link
polygamy with Mormonism).
19
Early Mormon scripture encouraged polygamy. Hayes, supra note 3, at
101–02. However, facing pressure from the United States government and citing divine guidance, LDS Church leader Wilford Woodruff declared in 1890 in a
document known as “The Manifesto” that the Church would no longer practice
plural marriage. Id. at 103–04. Today, the Church has a policy to excommunicate
polygamous members. Id. at 104.

of the more insular communities have gained notoriety for abuses

the Polygamy Legalization Debate

113

Polygamy also occurs among some African American Muslims:
Nation of Islam members, who practice it for religious reasons,32
and women, especially in Philadelphia, who have used polygyny to
compensate for the high rate of incarceration among Black men.33
In addition, one observer asserts that some American-born converts
to Islam adopt polygamy as a continuation of the non-monogamous
sexual relationships in which they engaged before their conversions.34 While the total number of Muslim polygamists is unknown,
experts cite estimates such as 20,00035 and 50,000 to 100,00036—
numbers similar to those of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists.
However, while legalization advocacy among the latter demographic has been growing,37 Muslims have largely refrained from
making similar moves. Muslim and fundamentalist Mormon polygamy are situated somewhat differently, because while the LDS
Church rejects polygamy,38 the Qur’an permits it––albeit with strict

of African immigrants in New York practice polygamy). Bernstein writes that
while Muslims among this population draw on Islamic guidance in their marital
choices, polygamy is also more broadly cultural, with non-Muslim African immigrants practicing it as well.

prerequisites. The lack of activism among both polygamist Muslims and community leaders who might advocate on their behalf
has been attributed to a number of factors, including: many Muslims’ abhorrence of polygamy;40 Muslim polygamists’ lower fear of
prosecution, not having experienced the traumatic enforcement
efforts that fundamentalist Mormons historically have;41 a view
among many Muslim polygamists that government recognition
is not crucial;42 and concerns about the negative publicity such
activism would bring at a time when Muslims are beset by severe
Islamophobia.43 There is a sense that, in this climate, polygamy
legalization simply “isn’t a priority . . . ‘while mosques are being
firebombed.’”44 Attention to the question of whether Muslims will
advocate for legalization may be outsized. The issue appears both
within media coverage of Muslim polygamists45 and sometimes
within coverage of American Muslims in general.46 This may be

tropes about Muslims attempting to replace secular American jurisprudence with religious law.47
In the Jewish community, polygamy also takes varied forms.
Some Jewish polygamists identify with aspects of secular polyamory culture, variously feeling that it complements their religious
beliefs and that the two conflict.48 Polygamy plays a different role
in the Orthodox Jewish community, in what is known as “the agunah crisis.”49 Traditional Jewish law requires husbands to give their
wives a religious bill of divorce (called a get) in order for their religious marriage, which is distinct from any civil marriage,50 to end.51
Sometimes, a husband who has separated from his wife and completed a civil divorce will refuse to grant a Jewish bill of divorce,
leaving his wife an agunah, or “chained woman.”52 A 2011 survey
found 462 instances of Jewish divorce refusal in North America
over a five-year period.53
Often the husband’s recalcitrance is accompanied by demands
for money or favorable child custody arrangements.54 Agunot (plural
of agunah) may, of course, marry again under civil law if they have
obtained a civil divorce. But under Jewish law, they may not enter
another religious marriage.55 This restriction makes civil remarriage
unacceptable for most of these religious women.56 Although Jewish

B.

The Polyamory Community
In contrast to most of these religious communities, secular
polyamory has its roots in the 1960s subcultures of free love and
paganism.59 Today, the polyamory community prides itself on what
it considers a progressive view of sexuality60 and retains ties with
pagan practitioners, as well as with science fiction and kink enthusiasts.61 Polyamorist philosophy prizes honesty and in-depth negotiation within relationships62 as well as the pursuit of “compersion,”
an emotion that replaces jealousy with happiness for a partner’s
other love relationships.63 Polyamorous relationships can be highly structured and committed, like a marriage, or they can be more
fluid.64 Models vary widely, including both plural and group relationships, and a range of gender combinations.65 Some members of
the community are eager for government recognition,66 while others feel that the rigidity of civil marriage would compromise the
autonomy and openness of their lifestyles.67 Statistical research on

the community is sparse, and complicated by the many varieties
of non-monogamy. Estimates range from 500,000 practitioners to
twelve million practitioners.68
C.

Interrogating the Religious/Secular Distinction
The customary division between religious and secular polygamy, sketched above, is porous and imprecise. American polygamy
does not cleanly split into libertine secular polyamory and sexist, closed enclaves of religious polygyny. We can instead categorize polygamy into several, sometimes overlapping, groups. Some
polygamists, such as members of the Fundamentalist Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (“FLDS”), believe that polygyny is religiously mandated.69 Other faiths permit polygamy without
requiring it,70 and some polygamists form non-monogamous partnerships for completely secular reasons, with religion facilitating
the arrangement.71 Conversely, the polyamory community, widely
considered secular, includes adherents who are Jews,72 pagans,73 and
Unitarians,74 some of whom link their romantic practices to their
religious ones.75
In addition, “cultural polygamy”—a term that encompasses
a variety of marital practices with non-Western roots—often transcends the religious/secular distinction. Adrien Katherine Wing
traces polygamy among African Americans from its African origins
to the present-day United States, noting an ebb and flow of religious
and secular influences. Black slaves were kidnapped from cultures

with insufficient numbers of men, where polygamy was practiced
for both cultural and religious reasons.76 Once in the United States,
they were stripped of their cultural practices, but also forbidden
from participating in Christian marriage.77 In response to forced
separation of families, slaves developed de facto marriage practices, in which they could marry a new spouse without divorcing
a previous one.78 This history continues today, in a different form,
among some African American women who perceive a shortage of
eligible men to marry.79 A portion, but not all, of these women are
religious.80 Scholars often discuss cultural polygamy among African
Americans, as well as among other non-white groups, such as Vietnamese Hmong immigrants and Native Americans, in tandem with
religious polygamy.81 This synthesis underscores the “otherness”
of religious polygamists in American society—a lens that extends
even to white Mormon and Christian polygamists82—and highlights
the uncertain lines that can exist between religion and culture more
generally. Both religious and “cultural” polygamy draws heavily on
tradition. Secular polyamory, too, has developed its own culture and
espouses distinct moral teachings.83
These definitional ambiguities will affect the applicability and scope of any pro-polygamy religious freedom holding. For
example, were judges to create an exemption to polygamy bans
for religious practitioners, they would be forced to grapple with
whom the exemption covered. They could decide to limit it only
to people who feel compelled by their religion to marry more than
one person, or could define it more broadly to also include those
who feel no religious obligation to marry more than one person,

but nevertheless practice polygamy within a religious framework.
This could become the type of messy inquiry into religious belief
that courts try to avoid. In addition, it is unclear whether a completely definitive distinction between religious and less-religious
motivations would be possible. Such questions would be especially pressing in analyses under state Religious Freedom Restoration
Acts (“RFRAs”), where courts would consider whether anti-polygamy laws impose a substantial burden on religion.84 However, these
difficulties would be less salient in federal constitutional cases. The
test in First Amendment litigation focuses on whether laws are neutral and generally applicable to both religious and secular activities
rather than on the extent of the burden on religious practice itself.85
II. Polygamy in American Law
This Part describes the legal environment in which American polygamists live, moving from the federal government’s divergent approaches to Native American and Mormon polygamy in
the nineteenth century, to modern-day polygamy bans. There have
been several challenges to such laws, primarily in Utah. None have
had more than temporary success, leaving in place a plethora of
negative impacts on polygamous families.
A.

History, Statutes and Case Law
American law’s early confrontations with polygamy involved
Native Americans and Mormons. Nineteenth-century state governments varied in their approaches to the practice among the former population, with some voiding Native Americans’ polygamous
marriages, but most recognizing them.86 The federal government
elected not to void the marriages.87 In contrast, due to fears about
the LDS Church’s political power,88 and anxiety about the practice
of polygamy itself, Congress moved aggressively and repeatedly to
curb polygyny among early Mormons.89 Its efforts included banning plural marriage and cohabitation in the territories, disqualifying polygamists from voting, revoking the LDS Church’s charter,90

and seizing Church assets. The Church conceded in 1890, renouncing plural marriage.92 Congress cemented its victory with the Utah
Enabling Act, which premised Utah’s statehood on inclusion of an
anti-polygamy provision in its constitution.93
Some Mormons resisted both the Church’s change in doctrine
and the government policies that precipitated it. In 1874, a polygamist named George Reynolds volunteered to be indicted in order
to contest Congress’s polygamy ban.94 The Supreme Court rejected
his free exercise claim. It held that while freedom of religious belief
was protected by the Constitution, freedom of religious conduct,
when it conflicted with a criminal prohibition,95 or when it was “in
violation of social duties[,] or subversive of good order,” was not.96
The Court assailed the practice of polygamy, reasoning that it “has
always been odious among the northern and western nations of
Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was
almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African
people.”97 The court asserted that polygamy “leads to the patriarchal principle,” creating an undemocratic, “stationary despotism” in
the societies where plural marriage is found.98 Gibbs and Campbell
observe that contemporary attitudes toward polygamy were rooted
not only in the Orientalist and anti-Mormon sentiment observable
in Reynolds, but also in prejudice against Native Americans99 and
African Americans.100 During this period, Mormon polygamists
faced, in addition to legal sanction and social censure, violence from
their neighbors.101
Today, polygamy is prohibited in every state, in a battery
of laws that employ generic language that does not specify any

religious or cultural group. Forty-nine states explicitly ban polygamous unions, and in the fiftieth, Hawaii, such marriages are void.102
Some states additionally criminalize cohabitating in a polygamy-type relationship, either as such or in cases where the family
has created a plural marriage in another jurisdiction.103 Utah law
states that “[a] person is guilty of bigamy when, knowing he has
a husband or wife or knowing the other person has a husband or
wife, the person purports to marry another person or cohabits with
another person.”104
Challenges to this statute, in both federal and state courts, have
formed the bulk of modern polygamy jurisprudence.105 One prominent question has been whether Reynolds, now almost a century
and a half old, still controls.106 Potter v. Murray City, a Tenth Circuit
case decided in 1985, held that it did.107 Additionally, the court used
the updated free exercise framework of its era to apply strict scrutiny to Utah’s statute, finding it justified by “a vast and convoluted
network of laws clearly establishing its compelling state interest in
and commitment to a system of domestic relations based exclusively
on the practice of monogamy as opposed to plural marriage.”108 Two
decades later, in a decision vacated by an appellate court for lack of
standing, a Utah federal district court found that Potter, and likely
also Reynolds, were still binding.109 The appellate court remarked
that had it considered the plaintiffs’ challenge on the merits, they
would have faced “a litany of seemingly insurmountable precedential obstacles,” primarily Potter and modern-day Supreme Court
decisions that have treated Reynolds as still in effect.110
The Utah Supreme Court has also upheld the statute. In State
v. Green, the court ruled that the law was neutral and generally applicable under post-Hialeah free exercise doctrine, because the statute did not distinguish between religious and secular polygamists,

and because it did not have carve-outs that made it applicable only
to faith-based unions.111 The opinion noted that the state’s most
recent bigamy prosecution involved a man in a non-religious relationship.112 The court then found that the Utah law passed rational
basis scrutiny, because it furthered government interests in regulating marriage both by “protecting vulnerable individuals from
exploitation and abuse” and through Potter’s “network” of monogamy-related laws.”113
This free exercise holding was reiterated in State v. Holm.114
Holm also held that Lawrence v. Texas, the case that found a fundamental right to same-sex intimate relationships,115 did not protect
a right to engage in “polygamous behavior.”116 The court construed
Lawrence narrowly to encompass only private sexual activity by
same-sex couples, and wrote that polygamy implicated the state’s
interest in regulating marriage in a way that Lawrence did not.117
Moreover, the mandate that Lawrence did not apply to minors
proved fatal in light of the Holm defendant’s marriage to a sixteenyear-old girl.118
In a comprehensive dissent to Holm, Chief Justice Durham
argued that, while she believed the “purport to marry” prong of the
statute was valid, its anti-cohabitation provision violated free exercise under the Utah state constitution.119 She wrote that although
she believed Utah had an interest in regulating marriage, cohabitation did not implicate that interest because prosecutors did not target all polygamous cohabitants, only religious ones.120 In addition,
she concluded that prosecutors’ asserted use of the statute to investigate collateral crimes in polygamous communities was too much
of a “fishing expedition” to justify the law.121 “Despite the difficulties that are always associated with gathering evidence in closed
societies,” she argued, “the state is held to the burden of proving
that individuals have engaged in conduct that is criminal because

it is associated with actual harm.” Turning to the appellant’s due
process rights, Chief Justice Durham argued that if the appellant’s
partner had not been a minor, their cohabitation would have been
protected by Lawrence.123 She argued that Lawrence protected not
only same-sex intimacy, but also polygamous cohabitants’ right to
make decisions about their relationships.124
Most recently, after law enforcement officials announced they
were investigating the Brown family (of the popular television
show Sister Wives), the Browns brought a lawsuit in federal court
challenging the Utah statute.125 The Tenth Circuit eventually found
their claims moot, based on a statement by the county attorney that
he did not intend to prosecute the Browns.126 This finding vacated
a district court decision127 that had been partially in their favor.128
However, the lower court opinion remains a hopeful omen for
polygamists, as it is the first case to find a polygamous cohabitation
ban violative of free exercise. The court held that because prosecutors targeted religious polygamists, and not secular adulterers, who
presumably violated the law in large numbers, the cohabitation provision was not neutral or generally applicable.129 The court concluded that the law was not supported by a compelling state interest,
finding that the criminalization of cohabitation did not advance the
state’s network of laws around monogamy.130 Quoting extensively
from Chief Justice Durham’s Holm dissent, the court also ruled that
the law was not sufficiently tailored to support a government interest in protecting women and children from abuse.131
In contrast, the court found that the marriage prong of the
statute did not violate free exercise. The plaintiffs had not proven that the provision was sufficiently linked to the discriminatory
anti-polygamy legislation of the nineteenth century. In addition,
Reynolds remained binding.132 Furthermore, the Brown court found

Legal And Social Ramifications Of Polygamy Bans

When . . . you’re trying to live as a [polyamorous] unit,
. . . the legal system doesn’t have a lot to offer you. . . .
—Kaitlin Prest137
Anti-polygamy laws cause grave harm to polygamous families. First, parents struggle with state parenting laws, sometimes
losing custody of their children when courts rule that a polyamorous family structure is not in the child’s best interest.138 In one
high-profile case, a polyamorous woman lost custody after a legal
fight with her child’s paternal grandmother.139 Non-biological polyamorous parents also encounter difficulty guardianship.140 Fear of
losing their children incentivizes polygamous parents to stay out of
family court, making it harder for them to challenge discriminatory case law,141 and arguably constraining legally married partners’
access to divorce.142
Financial arrangements can also be arduous. Without a civil
marriage, polygamous spouses receive no protection from intestacy statutes, none of the tax benefits of monogamous marriage, and
none of the protections of dissolution regimes. They must tussle
with their insurance providers to list their spouses as beneficiaries.143 Healthcare poses additional challenges. Non-legally married

spouses can be denied access to their partners’ hospital rooms,144
and non-biological parents can be denied access to those of their
children.145 Polygamous spouses without civil marriage recognition
cannot effectuate their incapacitated partners’ wishes.146
Moreover, immigration law restricts prospective polygamous
Americans. Polygamous families are denied immigration visas, as
are individuals who intend to begin a polygamous family at any
time during their future in the United States.147 The government
rejects green card applicants for similar reasons.148 The polygamous spouses of asylum grantees are also denied entry to the
country.149 In addition, immigrant polygamists in the United States
live in fear they will be deported if their family structure is discovered.150 Both immigrant and non-immigrant polygamists risk criminal prosecution.
Finally, polygamists face intense stigma. Aviram and Leachman describe members of the polyamory community experiencing
“fear and stress . . . due to keeping their polyamorous relationship[s]
secret or leading double lives,”151 as well as “alienation from family
members and friends who are unable to accept their lifestyle[s],”
and “difficulties in joining social organizations.”152 Casey Faucon
reports similar dynamics for religious polygamist wives, who “can
only reveal their married status in certain circles, as their relationships are relegated to a place of silence and inferiority in public for
fear of social stigma or criminal sanctions.”153 Anti-polygamy stigma
also reaches those who do not themselves practice polygamy but

whose religious communities are associated with it, namely LDS
Mormons154 and Muslims.155
Many of these experiences echo those of same-sex couples in
the pre-Obergefell era (and on the social front, at times still today).156
It is difficult to measure the precise extent to which anti-polygamy
laws cause stigma. It is reasonable to infer, however, that they do
contribute to it.157 Legalizing polygamy provides an opportunity to
greatly improve polygamists’ quality of life and to provide access to
a host of legal resources they currently cannot reach.
III. Free Exercise and Diversity
American religious freedom jurisprudence does not use the
promotion or maintenance of religious diversity as an element of
any legal test. However, our nation’s commitment to protecting
freedom of religious conscience fundamentally entails respect for
diverse beliefs and practices. As Hialeah notes, it was “historical
instances of religious persecution and intolerance that gave concern to those who drafted the Free Exercise Clause.”158 Whether

approval ratings will rise. See Gary J. Gates & Taylor N. T. Brown, Williams

that dramatically reduced litigants’ opportunities to invalidate laws
on religious freedom grounds, wrote that “we value and protect . . .
religious divergence.”160 Although Smith overruled the compelling
interest test used in Yoder, the latter’s dicta on religious tolerance
remains highly relevant to today’s polygamy debates. The court
cautioned readers that:
There can be no assumption that today’s majority [of
Americans] is “right” and the Amish and others like
them are “wrong.” A way of life that is odd or even
erratic but interferes with no rights or interests of others
is not to be condemned because it is different.161
However, we can see from this excerpt that bias may still
creep into judges’ decisions, even when they profess to respect
diversity. The Yoder court could have chosen to simply describe the
Amish’s practices as different from the majority. Instead, the Court
used the more judgmental label “odd.”162 When a religious practice
is as widely opposed as polygamy, it becomes especially important
for judges to be conscious of potential biases. In his concurrence
to Holm, Justice Nehring both acknowledged this, and revealed
his own anti-polygamy standpoint. He wrote that while he did not
allow popular opinion to influence his vote, his prognosis that:
[I]n the public mind[,] Utah will forever be shackled to
the practice of polygamy. This fact has been present in
my consciousness, and I suspect has been a brooding
presence ... in the minds of my colleagues, from the minute we opened the parties’ briefs.163

on the threshold questions of such analyses: whether, in federal constitutional claims, polygamy bans will be found neutral and generally applicable, and whether, in states that possess RFRAs or RFRAlike constitutional provisions, courts will find that the bans impose
a substantial burden on a sincerely held religious belief. Casey Faucon suggests that Americans have such negative associations with
religious polygamy that free exercise is not a politically viable doctrine for legalization.165 Unpopular minorities, however, need religious liberty protection more than anyone. Cases protecting these
populations explicitly on the grounds of free exercise are especially
powerful at a time when such arguments are frequently perceived
on the left as cover for discrimination against sexual minorities.166
Lest a widely applicable, historic doctrine lose support amidst the
very specific tumult of contemporary disputes about religiously
motivated denials of service to same-sex couples, polygamists can
remind liberals not to lose faith in religious liberty.
In addition, a religious liberty approach to polygamy provides
a platform to uphold a broad range of political and moral values.
Conservatives should embrace the opportunity to demand respect
for conservative religious practices. Although polygamy is certainly
unpopular amongst monogamists on the right,167 a religious liberty victory for fundamentalist polygamists would buttress calls by
conservatives that America’s model of diversity include them.168

Feminists, too, should acknowledge that the freedom of choice they
advocate includes the freedom to make conservative, even patriarchal, religious choices.169 A woman’s—or any person’s—liberty to
elect a liberal path is not truly protected in our society unless a full
spectrum of lifestyles is.
A.

Neutrality and General Applicability
In most of the United States, anti-bigamy statutes will be
found clearly neutral and generally applicable. No state’s law mentions religion.170 All polygamy bans are broad enough that they
encompass secular polygamous families. And because enforcement
is rare, selective enforcement is not usually a concern. As a result,
most state anti-polygamy laws will receive rational basis scrutiny
under Smith and Hialeah.
However, in states where polygamy has a higher profile, especially Utah, the question of neutrality and general applicability
will be more heavily litigated. The fight will implicate questions
about whether legislators and law enforcement have targeted a
religious minority, and about the relationship between our current
anti-polygamy regime and America’s heritage of anti-Mormon
discrimination.171
Polygamy cases have often ignored these roots, holding simply that Utah’s law is neutral and generally applicable, without
commenting on the possibility of that past discrimination may have
impacted the current statute or its enforcement. For example, in
State v. Green, the court wrote that in addition to being facially neutral, Utah’s statute was not designed in a manner that focused its
impact on religious polygamists.172 Taking a more nuanced approach,
ing that “[i]f liberals meant what they said, they would push for ‘diversity’ to
include political conservatives, Southern Baptists, and others unlike themselves.
How often does that happen? It seems that ‘diversity’ only applies to racial and
sexual minorities.”).

Rights Claims, 98 Cal. L. Rev. 197, 223 (2010) (arguing that “[c]omparing polygamy activists’ claims with other sex rights claims reveals that the contradictions
and ambiguities of . . . [polygamy plaintiffs] do not place them outside the realm
of recognizable sex rights claims. Many LGBT activists, feminists, and other sex
rights claimants have a multifaceted and nuanced relationship with different
sex rights values, such as autonomy, equality, and freedom from gender- or sexuality-related harm.”).

the district court in Brown addressed at length the anti-Mormon
bias present in nineteenth and early twentieth century legal treatment of polygamy. The court concluded that while the polygamy
legislation of that era was clearly rooted in prejudice against Mormons, the Browns had not shown the modern Utah statute, part of
a new penal code the state adopted in 1973, to have a similar history
The court did find that the religious cohabitation prong of
the statute was neither operationally neutral nor generally applicable.173 Key to the court’s analysis was the fact that Utah enforced
the law almost solely against religious polygamous cohabitation,
which left secular adulterers unprosecuted.174 Statements at oral
argument by the government’s attorney indicated that enforcement
efforts specifically targeted religious cohabitants.175 The court criticized the simplistic treatment some Utah precedent gave to government prosecutorial behavior and called earlier courts’ approaches
“too tidy” and “antiseptic.”176 The Brown opinion stated that when
other courts considered the factors that had prompted prosecution,
they left the religious basis of those factors unacknowledged.177 For
example, in Holm, the majority found an FLDS marriage ceremony
indicative of the defendant’s intent to enter a marriage.178 Brown
accused the Holm court of attempting to present this evidence as
secular in nature, when in reality, the court’s analysis established
that “the religious marriage ceremony or religious motivation of
the participants [. . .] could function as a bright line by which to
define the crime of bigamy in Utah.”179 Religious criteria, according
to Brown, thus motivated the Holm court’s holding.
The Brown opinion shows a laudable engagement with both
the history and current state of plural marriage in the law. Prior cases have often failed to address the potential animus against religious
practice that may be present in Utah’s statute or its enforcement.
Brown’s criticisms additionally call attention to the possibility of
cial neutrality, and that despite the existence of the one non-religious polygamy case it cited, it should have considered Utah’s general practice of refraining
from enforcing the law against secular polygamous families); Cf. Bronson v. Swensen, 394 F. Supp. 2d 1329, 1333 (C.D. Utah 2005) (finding Smith and Hialeah
analyses unnecessary in light of Potter, but failing to mention that historical discrimination could conceivably have been pertinent to those inquiries).

bias in the precedent decisions themselves. This bias does not have
to involve blatant disapproval of polygamists; rather, it can manifest
in a court’s failure to consider Yoder’s warning to avoid privileging
majority perspectives on religion.180 Courts have accepted government arguments with an insufficiently critical eye and have missed
the religious nature of the criminalized behavior.
Although the decision has been vacated, Brown’s focus on
enforcement provides a map for assessing anti-bigamy laws in jurisdictions where prosecutors selectively target religious polygamy.
In addition, any court considering a polygamy case should inquire
into the possibility that prejudiced targeting of religious practice
has played a role in its jurisdiction’s anti-polygamy regime. This
requires looking not only at history, but also at more subtle manifestations of discrimination, such as those articulated in Brown.
B.

State RFRAS and Constitutional Provisions
The most promising fora for polygamists’ religious freedom claims are jurisdictions with state constitutional provisions
or RFRAs requiring heightened scrutiny of laws that substantially burden religion. This is because RFRA cases will not require a
showing that anti-bigamy laws are not neutral and generally applicable. States that choose to interpret their religious freedom laws
according to the federal standard will be the most welcoming, as
they will follow Hobby Lobby’s emphasis on the stringency of the
least restrictive means test. Not only did the Hobby Lobby majority
call this standard “exceptionally demanding,”181 it indicated in dicta
that the federal RFRA’s standard may be even more favorable to
religious liberty plaintiffs than the framework used before Smith.182
This picture is complicated by the lack of a RFRA in Utah,
the most prominent state in polygamy litigation. In addition, some
states with RFRAs also possess constitutional provisions banning
polygamy.183 Arizona, a state with significant numbers of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists,184 falls into this category.185 Pennsylvania, however, is home to significant numbers of Black Muslim

polygamists and possesses a state RFRA as well as no constitutional prohibition.188
Under all state RFRAs, polygamist plaintiffs will have tot
show that their jurisdiction’s criminalization of religious cohabitation, and lack of marriage recognition, constitute a substantial
burden on their exercise of religion. The exactingness of this standard differs across circuits.189 The government may argue that only
bans on cohabitation, not marriage, create a sufficient burden.190
The theory would be that partners’ inability to live together is religiously burdensome, but their lack of a marriage license is not. So
far, courts in the modern Utah decisions have not questioned the
religious burden experienced by polygamist parties. This may be
because the facts in most of those cases were not relevant to such
an approach. For example, in Potter, Green, Holm, and Brown, the
polygamists did not seek civil marriage licenses.191 In the district
court decision in Brown, the court emphasized that cohabitation
was protected in part because the plaintiffs were not seeking civil
marriage in their cohabitation claim.192
It is plausible to imagine a future case, with a plaintiff seeking marital recognition, where the government would challenge the
religious nature of his or her request. Utah’s Supreme Court has
held that that the state has an interest in criminalizing bigamy to
prevent polygamists from committing marriage fraud.193 The government may argue that the civil marriage demands of religious
polygamists are less an attempt to practice religion than a grab for
government benefits, and thus that anti-polygamy laws do not burden their free exercise. This charge should prompt a very fact-specific inquiry in each case. In addition, claims by litigants who prac186

tice polygamy within the structure provided by their religion, but
who are indeed driven by secular factors, may not survive this step
of the analysis.194
The result will also depend on two doctrinal factors: whether the circuit in question emphasizes centrality or compulsion of a
religious practice in their substantial burden tests195 and how deferential the court is to a plaintiff’s characterization of his or her
religious beliefs. On the one hand, courts often defer to plaintiffs to
avoid entangling themselves in an evaluation of religious doctrine.
Hobby Lobby, however, engaged in a deep examination of the substantial burden question.196 It is possible the Court felt comfortable
doing so because it was finding for the religious party, as opposed
to looking in depth at a religious belief in order to reject its weight.
This might raise more entanglement concerns than the former.
If courts engaged in a comprehensive substantial burden
inquiry, plaintiffs would have a strong analogy to Hobby Lobby.
Just as the Hobby Lobby employers experienced a substantial burden on their religious practice when they suffered financial penalties for denying insurance coverage to their employees for certain
types of contraception that the employers deemed sinful,197 polygamists experience a burden because they cannot access the government benefits married couples receive.198 Yet even if plaintiffs’
claims failed on this question, an evenhanded substantial burden
analysis would be a partial victory for religious diversity. Courts
evaluating plural marriage cases have long contented themselves
with conclusory analysis, failing to engage with the realities of
polygamy.199 Judges should bring a journalistic openness to the testimony of polygamist litigants, and should not subject polygamy to
more skepticism than other religious practices.
194
See supra notes 70–76 and accompanying text (describing the varying
motivations of religious polygamists); Baron, supra note 183, at 329 (arguing that plaintiffs whose polygamy is not religiously compelled will lose their
RFRA suits).

There would be some tension between this argument and a denial by
plaintiffs of potential government assertions that plaintiffs seek marriage recognition for financial benefit, rather than for the purpose of practicing their religion. See supra note 194 and accompanying above-the-line text (describing
this argument). However, there is a difference between showing that plaintiffs
have suffered financially from denial of a right and assertions that plaintiffs
only seek to redress that denial for financial reasons.

[Vol. 24.107

Those who critique Hobby Lobby on feminist grounds may
argue that using the case to aid polygynists would further entrench
religious liberty with the suppression of women’s rights.200 However, the religious practice at issue in polygamy cases is very different
from the contraception dispute of Hobby Lobby. Unless coercion
is involved,201 women choose to participate in the religious exercise
of polygamy. It is their religious exercise, alongside their partners’,
which is burdened—unlike in Hobby Lobby, where women were
subject to the consequences of their employers’ religious practice.202
IV. Substantive Due Process and Autonomy
Religious liberty victories in the courts would allow religious
polygamous families to live more openly, reducing social stigma for
all polygamists. This could in turn make judges feel more comfortable granting substantive due process protection to secular (and all)
polygamy.203 Many polygamists are not religious, and a fundamental
rights approach will be necessary to protect the entire population.
Substantive due process litigation will likely proceed in a piecemeal
nature, as legalization for interracial and same-sex marriage did—
first, with the decriminalization of relationships, and later, with full
marriage recognition.204
See infra Sections IV.B.2, IV.B.3 (discussing the harms to women that occur in some polygamous marriages, and why banning polygamy is not the correct solution to such harms).
201
See infra Section IV.B.3 (addressing issues of consent in polygamy).
202
Central to the Court’s holding was its argument that women would not
ultimately suffer any consequences. They were to retain access to contraception
through a government workaround. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2760. However,
the viability of this procedure remains uncertain, as litigation about it continues in Zubik v. Burwell. Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S.Ct. 1557, 1560 (2016) (per curiam) (remanding cases to lower courts to consider a possible accommodation
for employers who argued that notifying the government of their intention to
not provide contraceptive coverage constituted a substantial burden on their
religious practice).
203
Ruling against polygamy, the Potter court similarly commented that legalizing religious polygamy could have implications for secular polygamists.
The court contended that if the Potter plaintiff received a religious exemption
from Utah’s polygamy ban, it would be very difficult to maintain the prohibition for the rest of the population. Potter v. Murray City, 585 F. Supp. 1126, 1139
(D. Utah 1984). (“It would be the height of naiveté to suppose that the lawful
practice of polygamy thus could be limited to those of the plaintiff’s faith, leaving aside the problem of the false assertion of religious motivation for physical gratification. The gate would be open by the developing trend of decision to
everyone who might desire more than one wife at a time on the basis of his own
particular religious belief.”) (emphasis added).

the Polygamy Legalization Debate

135

This Part argues that judges should ground their approach
to polygamy in the jurisprudence of autonomy that the Supreme
Court has built in its cases about marriage and related substantive
due process rights.205 The right to be married is a protected liberty;
the Court has also explicitly and consistently reaffirmed the right to
make choices about marriage, such as “the decision of whether and
whom to marry.”206 In the last twenty-five years, Justice Kennedy’s
opinions in Casey, Lawrence, and Obergefell have established that
this decision-making is an integral component of the ways individuals define themselves. His opinions have emphasized that personal
development requires freedom from legislative or judicial attempts
to proscribe answers to our choices. This Part argues that we should
apply these principles to find fundamental rights to polygamous
cohabitation and polygamous marriage, and addresses three significant objections to doing so—the immutability argument, the abuse
argument, and the consent argument.
A.

Finding a Fundamental Right to Make Autonomous
Decisions About Polygamy
In Obergefell, Justice Kennedy presented four principles and
traditions that establish why the Due Process Clause protects samesex marriage. Despite scattered mentions of “two” and “couple,”207
184, 196 (1964). Similarly, before finding that same-sex couples were included in
the right to marry, the Court protected same-sex intimate relationships in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). See Douglas NeJaime, Windsor’s Right to
Marry, 123 Yale L.J. Online 219, 237–40 (2013) (illustrating how LGBT rights
activists influenced judicial understandings of same-sex relationships, winning progressively larger victories over time), http://www.yalelawjournal.org/
pdf/1205_3mchpr78.pdf.
205
Though outside the scope of this paper, polygamy advocates should also
draw on equality values in their arguments. Obergefell described a marriage
jurisprudence informed by interlocking substantive due process and equal
protection principles, holding that inequality of access to marital recognition
placed a “disability on gays and lesbians [that] serve[d] to disrespect and subordinate them”—an experience familiar to polygamists. See Obergefell v. Hodges,
135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602–05 (2015).
206
Id. at 2599 (quoting Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 440
Mass. 309, 322 (2003)).
207
E.g., “The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms . . .” Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2599; “[e]
xcluding same-sex couples from marriage thus conflicts with a central premise
of the right to marry.” Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2600. These passages reveal a
clear emphasis on two-party marriage, likely a response to the concerns about
polygamy prevalent in public discourse around same-sex marriage and raised
by some of the dissenting Justices. See supra notes 5–6 and accompanying text
(describing polygamy analogies made by Justice Alito in oral argument and
by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent). However, just as Justice Kennedy de-

136

UCLA WOMEN’S LAW JOURNAL

[Vol. 24.107

all four principles and traditions apply just as much to polygamous
families as to two-partner families. For example, children of polygamous unions, like those of same-sex couples in the absence of legal
recognition for their parents’ unions, “suffer the stigma of knowing
their families are somehow lesser,”208 and live “a more uncertain
and difficult family life.”209 These children may be insecure about
whether they might be separated from their parents, and about
what might happen if a birth parent divorces the others or dies.210
Legalizing polygamy would also reinforce the stability of communities where polygamists live, a key consideration of Justice Kennedy’s analysis.211 Currently, polygamous families live outside the law,
some in communities profoundly isolated from the rest of society.212
Permitting their marriages would likely lead to more integration.213
In addition, it would contribute to social stability by providing
polygamous partners with the legal protections of marriage.214
Justice Kennedy’s first principle, autonomy, provides the
foundation for the right to marry. Since Loving v. Virginia, this
freedom has not merely been to engage in marriage, but to decide
to do so. The Loving court wrote that “[t]he freedom of choice to
marry [may] not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations”215
and that “[t]he freedom to marry or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the
State.”216 The Court continued to protect the right of individual
decision-making about marriage in Zablocki v. Redhail. Zablocki
held that a law requiring noncustodial parents with child support
obligations to obtain court approval to marry constituted “a serious
intrusion into their freedom of choice in an area in which we have
held such freedom to be fundamental.”217 Later, in Turner v. Safley,
scribed that our conception of marriage has evolved from the days of coverture to our modern pursuit of gender equality, greater understanding of the experiences of polygamous families creates grounds for a future Court to move
away from Justice Kennedy’s two-partner language. See Obergefell, 135 S. Ct.
at 2595–96 (tracing the development of our contemporary understanding of
marriage).

the Court again framed the right at stake as “the decision to marry.”218 Such discourse makes sense, as the Court’s seminal marriage
cases have focused less on the content of marriage—about what
married couples do, or how they relate to each other—than on
whether the State can prevent couples from exercising their choice
to enter a marriage in the first place.219
The Court has written in a similar tenor about related rights.
Eisenstadt v. Baird protected against “unwarranted governmental
intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the
decision whether to bear or beget a child.”220 Roe v. Wade is famously about choice.221 And in a later abortion case, Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Justice Kennedy described
an integral part of the decision-making autonomy the Constitution
protects: an agnate right of self-definition. Referencing the right
to make choices about marriage, procreation, and related issues,
Justice Kennedy wrote that “[a]t the heart of liberty is the right to
define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe,
and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could
not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under
compulsion of the State.”222 Decision-making is important because
it is a means by which the decision-maker forms his or her sense of
self—and this intensely personal process is contingent on freedom
from government interference.
Justice Kennedy went on in Lawrence and Obergefell to apply
this principle to intimate relationships and marriages between
same-sex couples.223 In Lawrence, he contrasted individual self-­
definition with majority moral rule. He emphasized that although

opposition to homosexuality is part of a belief system that is profoundly important to many Americans, the government may not
mandate that everyone conform to it.224 Legislatures and judges
should not “define the meaning of . . . [same-sex intimate] relationship[s] or set [their] boundaries absent injury to a person or
abuse of an institution the law protects.”225 Justice Kennedy further
grounded his opinion in autonomy terms by citing Casey’s language
about self-definition226 and by holding that individuals are free to
“choose to enter [same-sex] relationships.”227
Obergefell continues in a similar vein, holding that “the right
to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of
individual autonomy,”228 and that “choices about marriage shape an
individual’s destiny.”229 Lawrence had little to say about the nature
of the relationship it protected besides labelling it “a bond that . . .
[can be] enduring.”230 In contrast, the discussion of autonomy in
Obergefell is remarkably dense in its characterization of what exactly individuals choose when they choose marriage. Justice Kennedy
describes an institution of support, security, and “freedoms, such
as expression, intimacy, and spirituality.”231 Rhetorically, this does
not leave unlimited room for individuals to define for themselves
what they want the marriage decision to mean. Indeed, as a government figure promoting a specific view of marriage, Justice Kennedy
approaches the very dynamic he criticized in Casey.232 Regardless,
Obergefell ultimately protects the right of same-sex individuals to
choose to enter a marriage.233
Judges should extend this right to polygamous families
because they, too, deserve to make their own decisions about cohabiting with or marrying more than one person.234 Criminalization

and lack of recognition disrespect the dignity of all Americans,235
communicating that we are not capable of choosing the lifestyle we
each think is best. This especially impacts women, who have historically been deprived of agency in choices around sex and marriage.
Paternalistic attempts to protect women from polygyny’s alleged
harms reinforce that dynamic. Even if women were in danger of
making adverse choices about polygamy, the Court has previously
protected autonomous decision-making about marriage amid concerns about giving discretion to potentially vulnerable236 and irresponsible237 populations.238
Finally, polygamy’s low approval ratings among the American
population are immaterial. Although a certain amount of cultural
change occurred before the Court included interracial and samesex couples in the right to marry, the Court took those steps during
eras when such unions faced intense opposition.239 Clearly, the
habitation, while Obergefell would be used to require that states recognize polygamous marriages. Some may argue that the Court’s autonomy jurisprudence
only requires the state to decriminalize polygamy, not to affirmatively recognize it. See Peter Nicolas, Fundamental Rights in a Post-Obergefell World, 27
Yale J.L. & Feminism 331, 343–44 (2016) (describing the due process doctrine
of negative liberty, which prevents states from infringing fundamental rights,
but does not require them to facilitate access to them—for example, by providing abortions to women whose pregnancies fall within the parameters delineated by Roe and Casey). Two of the Obergefell dissents made arguments
about same-sex marriage to this effect. Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2620 (Roberts,
C.J., dissenting); id. at 2631 (Thomas, J., dissenting). However, the Obergefell
majority articulated a clear entitlement to state-recognized marriage for samesex couples. This approach is directly applicable to polygamous families. But see

Counterarguments to Applying The Court’s Autonomy
Jurisprudence to Polygamy

1.

Immutability
There is tension in the Obergefell opinion between Kennedy’s
discourse of independent decision-making and his numerous invocations of what he appears to view as an unchosen sexual orientation.240 Accordingly, polygamy opponents often seek to distinguish
polygamy from the Court’s same-sex precedent by arguing that
the latter involves an unchangeable need of gay people for samesex relationships, while polygamy is a choice.241 That contention
is sometimes countered by arguments that non-monogamy might
constitute its own sexual orientation,242 or that LGB sexual orientation might be conceptualized in a more complex, not entirely
immutable, way.243 This debate misses the point. Decriminalization
and marital recognition for polygamists matters because its absence
has deprived a population of agency and has caused suffering.244

the Polygamy Legalization Debate

Such conditions are not contingent on whether polygamists’ identities are malleable.245
The Obergefell opinion finds moral urgency in the argument
that without access to marriage, same-sex couples were “relegated
through no fault of their own” to exclusion and harm.246 However,
neither the ethical trajectory of the opinion nor its legal reasoning
requires immutable homosexuality. On the moral front, when Justice Kennedy describes the love the plaintiffs had for each other,
and the pain they experienced because they were unable to marry,
he does not characterize their sexual orientations in any way. He
simply writes that these individuals found same-sex partners who
became integral to their lives, and that their states’ marriage restrictions caused substantial hardships.247
Similarly, Obergefell’s discourse of autonomy, like that of the
Court’s earlier marriage cases, does not hinge upon the existence of
any immutable trait. Instead, the Court has foregrounded the right
to make choices about intimacy and family life because marriage
and related decisions are integral to our constitutional freedoms. As
Justice Kennedy writes in Obergefell:
Loving did not ask about a ‘right to interracial marriage’;
Turner did not ask about a ‘right of inmates to marry’;
and Zablocki did not ask about a ‘right of fathers with
unpaid child support duties to marry.’ Rather, each case
inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense [.]248
245
Id. Some contend that gay and lesbian individuals suffered more than
polygamists in the absence of marriage recognition, because while the former
could not marry anyone compatible with their sexual orientation, polygamy-favoring individuals are not limited to singlehood, just to one spouse. E.g., Saletan, supra note 241. This line of reasoning ignores the type of marriage that
polygamists suffer without—much as gay and lesbian couples find marital happiness in same-sex unions, polygamous partners do so in relationships of more
than two people. In addition, as discussed infra in this Part, the immutability
argument does not address the many individuals who could theoretically find
recourse from loneliness with either a same-sex or a different-sex spouse. For
them, suffering caused by governmental failure to recognize same-sex marriage
did not stem from the inability to marry anyone at all.

Loving v. Virginia is particularly instructive because its plaintiffs were also barred from marriage because of an immutable characteristic.249 The Court held that it was unconstitutional to exclude
the Lovings from the marriage right “on so unsupportable a basis
as . . . racial classifications.”250 Ultimately, the race of the plaintiffs
was not relevant for its own sake; what mattered was that the state
barred the Lovings from marrying based on an unacceptable criterion. Because the right to enter a marriage does not depend on race,
it is inconsequential to the doctrine whether race is immutable.
Similarly, the right to enter a same-sex marriage does not
depend on partners’ immutable, exclusively homosexual orientation. A bisexual person willing to marry a person of any gender may
also use this right, as may a person who identifies as completely
heterosexual. Accordingly, the presence or lack of immutability in
a polygamist’s preference for marrying multiple partners does not
affect whether he or she should be included in the right to marry.
2.

Abuse
In protecting the right to make choices about intimate partnerships, Lawrence pointedly excluded relationships that “involve
persons who might be injured.”251 Commentators frequently cite
the abuse that takes place in some fundamentalist Mormon communities as one of the government’s key interests in maintaining
polygamy bans.252 The crimes are indeed grave:
The stories of child brides revealed that they were born
and raised to become the next victims in a community of abuse.
....
The abuse these women experienced was not limited to
rape and violence. They also told of their experiences
being not only personally deprived of food but having
to watch their children go without food. This starving

than a fixed reality. E.g., Ta-Nehisi Coates, What We Mean when We Say ‘Race is

occurred when a woman ‘fell out of favor’ with her
‘husband.’ . . .
In the community, disfavored child brides and their children were publicly shunned. Some were even expelled
from the community and deprived of their children.253
Concerns about abuse proved persuasive in State v. Green,
where the court held that polygamy often “coincides” with serious
harms, and that protecting women and children was Utah’s most
important interest in its anti-bigamy statute.254 However, there is a
strong argument that as disturbing as the misconduct in question
is, abuse is already criminalized by other, more precisely targeted
laws. We should enforce those statutes, rather than overinclusively
banning all polygamy.255 This is the approach we take with monogamy,256 and it has begun to gain traction with some courts considering
polygamy cases.257
Furthermore, while it is difficult for law enforcement to investigate crimes in insular polygamous communities, many argue that
criminalization has actually propelled abuse.258 Fear of prosecution
has led FLDS polygamists to retreat to closed enclaves, where abusers benefit from their victims’ isolation.259 Victims worry that if they
seek help, they will be prosecuted under anti-bigamy statutes or
lose custody of their children.260 Legalizing polygamy has the potential to help states better protect plural wives and their children. By

contrast, criminalization puts them at risk, and denies equality to

3.

Consent
Autonomy in marital decision-making is premised on true
assent to enter a union; the Lawrence and Obergefell opinions
make clear that those cases only protect relations where consent is
present.261 Polygamy poses unique considerations in this area. First,
the instances of rape and forced marriage that occur in some fundamentalist Mormon communities262 demonstrate clear lack of consent. Second, some scholars charge that true consent, even where it
is asserted, is often missing in polygynous marriages due to strong
social and religious pressures and to the purportedly unequal nature
of this marital form.263 Such positions bring together philosophies
familiar from both the right and left—paternalistic guidance about
what’s best for women, and feminist articulations about the extent
of women’s power in a society with strong patriarchal roots.264 A different strand of feminism, prioritizing autonomy in decision-making, responds that we should respect all women’s choices, even when
they are made in an imperfectly egalitarian context.
Polygamy has additional features that make consent especially important. The addition of a new spouse will almost certainly affect the emotional relationship between existing partners. It
can also impact their finances, as a larger number of spouses may
mean a smaller share of family resources available for each. Such
considerations will likely expand if polygamy legalization introduces new systems of property distribution at divorce and intestacy.
Moreover, when polygamy is an option, spouses can wield power
over each other by threatening to add a new husband or wife to
the marriage.265 Recognizing the significance of concerns about consent in polygamous marriage, Part IV.B.3 will first address scenarios
of ambiguous consent, arguing that neither religious nor communal influences, nor power differentials between spouses, invalidate
women’s choices. It will then evaluate strategies for preventing
clearly coerced polygynous marriages. Our current criminalization
regime, which has pushed polygamous families underground, has
not prevented such abuses. Grassroots or government efforts to

offer social services to polygamous communities—providing them
education and support, and non-judgmentally accepting residents’
choices—have the best chance of increasing women’s agency.
a.
Ambiguous Consent
Beyond cases of clear coercion, some critics claim that polygyny, at least as practiced in some fundamentalist Mormon groups,
is inherently coercive. They argue women do not truly consent to
it, even when they purport to.266 The pressure comes from spiritual beliefs, such as fundamentalist Mormon teachings that salvation
is inaccessible without polygamy;267 from the comprehensive social
influences of communities that follow those teachings; and from
wives’ lack of exposure to alternative lifestyles.268 In addition, in
some communities, women must leave if they reject polygamy.269
Some commentators contend no woman can consent to polygyny
because such marriages are by definition unequal.270 Within this
framework, assent to a polygynous marriage proposal is not solely the woman’s decision, but rather the fruit of patriarchal forces.
The criminalization of polygamy, in turn, is necessary to disrupt
this dynamic.
Such perspectives, however, are themselves patriarchal.271 Not
only do they reject the decisions of polygamous women, but they
assert that these women do not make decisions at all. This wrests
agency from the very people advocates hope to protect as well as
reinforces the stereotype that women are not capable of making
their own choices. The mere existence of a fervent polygamy culture, imparted through family values and religious teachings, is not
sufficient to invalidate consent. Decisions can be difficult when a
person has strong incentives to conform to their community, but the
final choice ultimately resides with its maker.272 In addition, some

fundamentalist Mormon women convert to the faith, which allays
concerns that their consent is uninformed.273
Finally, a determination that polygynous women’s consent is
invalid because it occurs in a context of incomplete gender equality would implicate the decisions of all American women. Whether polygamous or monogamous, all women make decisions about
marriage in a society where social, ideological, and economic forces
restrict their freedoms.274 We should acknowledge that such conditions exist and work to change them. In the interim, we must
respect that women make conscientious choices every day about
how to navigate the inequalities they face.
b.
Addressing Lack Of Consent
How should the law respond to the suffering of women and
girls who truly do not consent to their polygynous marriages?
Cases of coercion do exist, and we have a responsibility to protect against it.
One popular suggestion is to require judicial approval of
polygamous marriages. Casey Faucon, drawing on polygamy regulation practices around the world, suggests a detailed application
process. The proposed spouses, each represented by private or
court-appointed attorneys, would consent to or negotiate around
default property arrangements, and participate in a hearing where a
panel of judges would determine whether consent exists, and whether any parties are ineligible to marry because of age or incest.275
Jacob Richards calls for legislation that would direct judges to evaluate consent based on the following factors: whether any pressures
influenced the parties to decline or accept the marriage proposal;
whether all parties are informed of their alternatives to polygamy;
their communities. In some fundamentalist groups, girls are not given adequate
education to support themselves in the outside world. Strassberg, supra note
268, at 375–76. Although these young women have the intellectual capacity to
make an alternative choice, their practical ability to leave is severely limited,
which in turns weakens their ability to consent to a polygamous marriage. However, practical constraints such as these are different from social or ideological
constraints. A woman facing strong social pressure or religious belief is an autonomous thinker who may choose to forge her own path; lack of education, on
the other hand, can make it nearly impossible to do so.

as marriages are often the site of power disparities between men and women).
In addition, it should be noted that that the right to marry does not require that
marriages display gender parity. Den Otter, supra note 10, at 1993–94.

whether the parties have effective opportunities to pursue those
alternatives; and whether the parties are part of a community that
restricts their choices.276
While these proposals provide a mechanism for judges to
observe coercion or abuse from a potential spouse’s testimony or
demeanor, they also pose several problems. First, states with large
numbers of polygamous families would require vast resources to
hold such hearings, especially if they appoint publicly funded attorneys. On the other hand, in jurisdictions where polygamy is rare,
judges may not develop the expertise necessary to effectively evaluate the difficult question of consent in the applications they do
assess. More importantly, judicial approval regimes raise many of
the concerns outlined in Part IV.B.3.b. about underestimating women’s decision-making capabilities. These hearings call to mind judicial approval of the marriages of minors.277 Furthermore, judges’
personal biases may impact the way they interpret testimony about
conservative religious communities. This is especially a concern if
judges are explicitly directed to evaluate the dynamics of a religious
culture, an inquiry to which Richards’ proposal alludes. The risk of
judges evaluating an application incorrectly is troubling in an inquiry over such a controversial and personal matter, especially when it
implicates a freedom as crucial as the right to marry. Finally, judicial
denial of a religious family’s application could potentially constitute a free exercise violation.278
An alternative to judicial approval regimes is community involvement by private activists or government social services
agencies. Richards’ research identified one public-private partnership to run support groups for polygamous wives.279 The groups discussed unhealthy relationship dynamics and maintained a supportive, neutral posture towards participants’ decisions to continue or
abandon their polygamous lifestyles.280 More widespread efforts in
this direction are necessary, especially programs that include inforRichards, supra note 169, at 240–42.
“Virtually all states allowing the marrying of minors require court approval in addition to parental consent.” Gale, Marriage Age Requirements, 50
State Statutory Surveys, 0080 Surveys 22 (2009). Of course, minors, who do
lack adult decision-making capabilities, should remain subject to their states’
judicial approval process, whether the marriage they seek is monogamous or
polygamous.

mation about recognizing coercion and abuse as well as provide
support for leaving or rejecting polygamy when such dynamics are
present. These efforts are more likely to gain the trust of wary fundamentalist polygynists than mandatory, invasive judicial hearings.
Over time, this approach may be the most effective way to bring
such communities out of the shadows, thereby increasing the likelihood that women will have the freedom to give true consent.
Conclusion
It is unclear how future free exercise and substantive due
process claims will ultimately come out. Perhaps the strongest
argument against recognizing plural and group marriages is one
of administrability. Unlike the legalization of same-sex marriage,
where officials merely had to remove gender designations, recognizing polygamy would prompt state and federal governments to
not only make procedural changes, but to refashion entire areas
of law. Rules about intestacy, parentage, and marital property, for
example, would have to be altered to reflect varying numbers of
spouses. Commentators have suggested several solutions to these
difficulties.281 Edward Stein observes that family law has already
shifted in dramatic ways to reflect changing American relationships,
such as by moving away from coverture and accommodating “serial polygamy,” wherein an individual marries and divorces multiple
times over the course of his or her life.282
Although these practical questions are important, it is essential to remember the larger context—the futures of spouses and
parents and children. The expense and creative thinking required
to update statutes and forms are a price that society should pay to
ensure that polygamous families live in dignity and equality.283
Once mandating coverture and excluding interracial and
same-sex unions, American marriage law has moved towards allowing couples greater freedom to define love as they see fit.284 This
