RAPE ON CAMPUS AND IN THE
MILITARY:
An Agenda for Reform

Deborah L. Rhode*
I. Introduction
“Sexual violence is more than just a crime against individuals,”
declared President Barack Obama in January 2014. “It threatens
our families; it threatens our communities. Ultimately, it threatens
the entire country. It tears apart the fabric of our communities . . . .
[W]e have the power to do something about it as a government, as a
nation.”1 This was, by all accounts, the first time an American president had ever used the phrase “sexual violence,” let alone made
dealing with it a national priority.2
That recognition of the problem was long overdue. The United States has the world’s second highest rate of reported rape.3
About sixteen to eighteen percent of American women and one to
three percent of American men have experienced an attempted or
completed rape.4 Only about a third of rapes and attempted rapes

are reported. Fewer than ten percent of sexual assaults will result
in a conviction.6 Of all the major felonies, rape is the least reported,
least indicted, and least likely to end in conviction.7
Rape has attracted increasing attention in two contexts: college campuses and military institutions. These contexts share two
distinctive features: both have disproportionately high rates of sexual assaults and internal procedures that have proven inadequate
to deal with them.8 This article focuses on the dynamics that have
contributed to the problem in those contexts, and the strategies that
must be part of the solution.

II. Campus Rape
A.

The Nature of the Problem
A major problem in addressing campus rape is the mismatch
between popular images of rape—a violent sexual assault by a
stranger—and the kinds of sexual coercion common in most college rapes.9 Among college women, about four-fifths of rapes and
attempted rapes involve acquaintances and almost ninety percent
involve no weapon.10 Women have been drinking or taking drugs
in a majority of cases.11

Rape on Campus

3

Only twelve to thirteen percent of students report the assault
to campus or law enforcement authorities.12 Reasons include self
blame, fear of reprisal, not wanting others to find out, not knowing
how to report, lack of proof, a belief that the conduct wasn’t serious enough to report, and expectations of dismissive treatment.13
Those expectations are not unfounded, and the experience of not
being believed can increase the trauma.14 A textbook illustration
of the problem surfaced in an Amherst College student’s widely-publicized account of her campus rape, in which a sexual assault
counselor told her that “[p]ressing charges would be useless, he’s
about to graduate, there’s not much we can do. Are you SURE it
was rape? It might have been a bad hookup . . . You should forgive
and forget.”15 In a similar case at Occidental College, an administrator reportedly told a complainant not to worry about safety
because the administrator had met the rapist and “he didn’t seem
like the type of person who would do something like that.”16 At the
University of Connecticut, a female campus police officer told a
complainant that “women have to just stop spreading their legs like
peanut butter” or rape will “keep on happening till the cows come

home.” These cases are not infrequent. Dismissive attitudes by
fellow students can be equally problematic. At some institutions,
coming out as a rape victim can be a form of “social suicide.”19 Two
University of Virginia students who went public were called “cunt”
and “feminazi bitch,” and one was physically assaulted.20 As one
rape crisis advocate notes, women who anticipate those reactions
“are pretty much saying ‘It’s not worth it . . . I’ll deal with it and
move on.’”21
Local law enforcement agents can be equally unsupportive.
Prosecutors want cases that they can win, and cases involving acquaintances and victims who act irresponsibly are often met with
skepticism.22 A recent case study in the flawed law enforcement
process involves Jameis Winston, a Florida State University quarterback who led his team to the national championship while accusations of rape were pending against him. The prosecutor handling
the case acknowledged a number of problems with the investigation. In fact, an exhaustive examination by the New York Times
found that there was “virtually no investigation at all, either by the
police or the university.”23 The police did not follow obvious leads
that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses,
one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter.24 Nor did the
police obtain a DNA sample after the complainant identified Winston as her assailant.25 The detective in charge of the case waited
two months to write his report, and then prematurely suspended his

inquiry. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence
had vanished, including the video of the assault.26 The university,
which knew about the rape accusation, did not even question Winston before allowing him to complete the full championship season.27 Not until almost two years after the assault, in the wake of
adverse publicity and a Title IX complaint, did the university open
an investigation.28 The Winston case is not unique. In another campus rape case occurring around the same time, the local police were
equally unsupportive. An officer suggested that an investigation
“would be futile, as this kind of stuff happens all the time here.”29
Taken together, these dynamics prevent the vast majority of
rapes from ever resulting in conviction. In one survey of 171 sexual
assaults investigated by police at six campuses, only seven percent
resulted in arrest and four in conviction.30
These negative law enforcement attitudes are widely shared.
Despite decades of reform efforts, it is the victim’s conduct, as well
as the assailant’s, that is on trial in rape proceedings. Jurors’ perception of the “moral character” of the complainant has traditionally been the single most important factor affecting outcomes.31
Research on public opinion and juror attitudes makes clear that
most Americans are reluctant to convict in acquaintance rape cases
where victims acted “irresponsibly” by drinking or “leading a man
on.”32 As a Maryland Supreme Court justice put it, when an adult
woman goes to a man’s room, “[s]he certainly [has] to realize that
they [are] not going upstairs to play Scrabble.”33 When alcohol is
involved, victims tend to be blamed more and perpetrators less.34

[Vol. 23.1

According to Camille Paglia, a “girl who lets herself get dead drunk
at a fraternity party is a fool. A girl who goes upstairs alone with a
brother at a fraternity party is an idiot. Feminists call this ‘blaming
the victim.’ I call it common sense.”35 A Toronto police officer told
a group of college women that if they wanted to avoid sexual assault, they should avoid dressing like “sluts.”36 A New York Times
article recounted the fate of a victim of a rape at a fraternity who
was ostracized and vilified after reporting the incident; the takeaway was in the title, “Reporting Rape, and Wishing She Hadn’t.”37
The tendency to hold victims accountable is deeply rooted.
As psychologist Melvin Lerner famously argued, people want to
believe in a just world in which people get what they deserve and
deserve what they get.38 In rape cases, the tendency is to discount
victims’ injury or blame victims for the assault.39
Another psychological dynamic that complicates acquaintance rape cases involves the inclination to resolve doubts in ways
that favor self-interest. Men whose interests lie in having sex are
likely to perceive ambiguous or conflicting signals as consent.
Women who come to regret the experience are likely to recall
making their opposition clear. The issue then becomes who should
bear the risk of misunderstandings, and how much responsibility
women have for not clearly communicating their preferences. A
common view is that overly inclusive definitions of rape give women unreasonable control to define, after the fact, what is or is not
acceptable, consensual sex.40 In one survey, fifty percent of male
athletes believed that almost half of women who report rape are
lying.41 Yet empirical research suggests that the rate of false report2773 (2007); Karla J. Stormo, Alan R. Lang & Werner G.K. Stritzke, Attributions

ing is much lower. Close to half of surveyed women are unwilling
to label forced sex between acquaintances rape, even when it meets
the statutory definition.42
The common assumption that “nonviolent” acquaintance
rapes do not involve serious harm is also inconsistent with the evidence. Data from the National Crime Center and Department of
Justice indicate that most rapes do not involve physical injury apart
from the assault itself, but that they often produce debilitating and
enduring psychological trauma.43 Survivors suffer high rates of depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder,
which can lead to problems in work and educational performance
and heightened college drop out rates.44 Acquaintance rape is no
less psychologically harmful than other assaults because it calls into
question a woman’s behavior, judgment, and sense of trust in ways
that acts of strangers do not. As one anonymous letter to the editor
of a campus paper explained, “I was raped about a year ago . . . by a
very public member of the student body . . . . He did not put a gun
to my head or threaten my life, but sometimes I have thought that
would have been better. Then I would have had a [sic] excuse for
‘letting this happen.’”45
A large percentage of campus rapes are committed by a small
number of repeat offenders. In one study of 1882 college men who
acknowledged committing acts that qualified as rape or attempted
rape, sixty-three percent were repeat offenders, with an average of
almost six rapes each.46 A large percentage of these men belong
to all-male organizations and teams that reward male conquests.47

constituted three percent of the male student body, were responsible for twenty percent of rapes.48 Another study found that that
over a quarter of incapacitated sexual-assault victims reported that
their assailant was a fraternity member.49 In a case all too emblematic of fraternity views, the Yale chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon
had its pledges chant “[n]o means yes, yes means anal” in front of
dorms housing women.50
B.

Campus Procedures
The inadequacy of campus procedures compounds the problem. In one all-too-typical experience, an Occidental student reported a rape to an administrator who did not direct her toward
any resources or review her legal options.51 Although the assailant
was ultimately found responsible and expelled, the complainant
felt more devastated than vindicated. The college’s administrative
procedure entitled her assailant to cross-examine her. “The adjudication board itself was one of the worst things I had to experience
outside of the actual assault, and in some ways it was worse.”52
An Onion parody captures reasons why. It portrays a rape
victim explaining to reporters: “‘I get to go into a room filled with
a committee of middle-aged men whose primary concern is upholding the college’s reputation and recount in explicit detail the
circumstances of my rape at the hands of another student—I can’t
wait,’ said the pleased 19-year-old, who noted that she’s particularly
looking forward to describing her choice of clothing the night of
the assault, explaining the nature of her relationship with her rapist, and entertaining a variety of questions aimed at determining
whether she herself invited the attack with her words and actions,
all the while offering a step-by-step account of the most horrific
night of her life. ‘Don’t get me wrong, it was great being interviewed
by the local and campus police, but this way I get to tell university officials who have a vested interest in minimizing campus rape

statistics . . . what exactly I was drinking and why I could have misremembered events.’”53
Those accused of sexual assault also fault campus adjudicative
processes for the lack of procedural protections. Many have sued
their institution, claiming that it scapegoated them in an effort to
show the effectiveness of its policies.54 In some institutions, including Harvard, the Title IX enforcement office acts as investigator,
prosecutor, judge, and jury; it even hears appeals, which raises obvious due process issues.55 Insensitivity to the rights of alleged perpetrators has also been apparent in the media. A celebrated recent
case is the Rolling Stone article in which the reporter failed to interview alleged perpetrators of a gang rape, and ignored discrepancies
in the account of the victim.56 According to the founder of Families
Advocating For Campus Equality, “[i]n their rush to judgment, colleges are now substituting one class of victims for another.”57
A related issue is the lack of concern among anti-rape activists for the due process rights of alleged perpetrators. Guardian
columnist Jessica Valenti describes the debate over campus adjudication reform this way: “On the one side, there are the 20 percent
of college women who can expect to be victimized by rapists and

would-be rapists; on the other side is a bunch of adult men (and a
few women) worrying themselves to death that a few college-aged
men might have to find a new college to attend.”58 This characterization of the debate trivializes the stigma of being labeled a rapist
and forced to apply to another institution with such a record.
It is impossible to know how often institutions have failed to
be sufficiently sensitive to alleged victims or alleged perpetrators.
What is clear is that even the best-intentioned members of adjudicative boards are often ill-prepared for the role. Senator Claire
McCaskill’s survey of 440 institutions found that a third failed to
provide basic training to the people adjudicating claims.59 Almost a
quarter gave athletic departments oversight of cases involving student athletes.60 Forty-one percent of schools had not conducted a
single investigation of sexual violence in the past five years. More
than a fifth conducted fewer investigations than the number of incidents that they reported to the Department of Education.61 Many
institutions lack formal cooperative understandings or good relations with local law enforcement agencies, which impedes criminal
proceedings when campus responses fall short.62 Some institutions
actively discourage complainants from going to the police.63 As one
commentator summarized the situation, colleges bring to the task
of responding to assault a “toxic mix of unqualified investigators,
underdeveloped judiciary processes, and conflicts of interest that
undermine both their effectiveness and their legitimacy.”64 Although experts agree that annual confidential surveys of students
are one of the best ways to get an accurate sense of campus sexual assaults, only sixteen percent of institutions conducted such
surveys.65 The limited evidence available also casts doubt on the

adequacy of the brief rape awareness programs that are common in
campus outreach efforts.66
A related problem involves the leniency of sanctions. A report by the Center for Public Integrity showed that only ten to
twenty-five percent of students found responsible for campus sexual assault are expelled.67 At the University of Virginia, no one has
been expelled for sexual assault in the last seven years; the University has punished students more harshly for cheating than for
rape.68 In its entire history, Stanford has expelled only one student
for rape.69 Sanctions at many institutions can be as minimal as probation, suspension during a summer term, requiring the offender to
write a letter of apology, or watching a brief educational video on
sexual violence and preparing a two-page reflection paper.70 When
asked to grade their school on handling sexual assault cases, less
than ten percent of students gave their school an A. Half gave their
school a C or lower.71
C.

Legal Standards
Part of the reason for the inadequacy of campus rape procedures is the inadequacy of legal enforcement structures. Title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972 requires schools that receive federal financial assistance to take necessary steps to prevent
sexual assaults and to respond promptly and effectively when an
assault is reported.72 The Clery Act requires schools that participate in federal financial aid programs to report annual statistics on
crime, including sexual assault and rape, on or near their campuses,

and to develop prevention policies. The Campus Sexual Violence
Elimination Act amended the Clery Act to require procedural protections for those reporting an assault, to establish standards for
disciplinary procedures governing assault, and to require prevention and awareness programming for students and employees.74 In
2014, the Department of Education promulgated new rules under
the Clery Act that require colleges to provide training for faculty,
staff, and students concerning policies on sexual misconduct, and
allow alleged perpetrators and victims to have advisors with them
throughout disciplinary proceedings.75
The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is
charged with enforcing Title IX. It may initiate an investigation
either proactively or in response to a formal complaint. If OCR
finds a Title IX violation, it can, in theory, withdraw federal funds.
In practice, that penalty has never been invoked.76 Rather, schools
that are found in violation enter into agreements requiring them to
take specified actions to remedy the problem.77 The Department of
Education’s Federal Student Aid Office is responsible for enforcing
the Clery Act, and conducts on-site reviews to ensure compliance.78
Violations of the Act can result in fines and orders to comply.79
By the spring of 2015, 106 colleges and universities were under investigation for Title IX violations in handling sexual assault
claims.80 If history is any guide, most of these investigations will not
result in federally mandated reforms. In one survey of complaints
between 1998 and 2008, the Department of Education ruled against
just five universities out of only twenty-four resolved complaints.81

Rape on Campus

13

In a Chronicle of Higher Education survey of 801 complaints between 2003 and 2013, only ten percent ended with an agreement
to change and only four percent resulted in a finding that the institution was out of compliance with Title IX.82 Part of the reason
for the low success rate may be resource constraints preventing
full investigations. Compared to twenty years ago, the OCR has
twenty-seven percent fewer staff members yet handles three times
as many complaints.83 A related problem is the lack of realistic
sanctions. Because institutions know that funding cutoffs are implausible, OCR has limited leverage in negotiating compliance. As
one Title IX complainant noted, “[c]ulture changes when there’s a
cost to wrongdoing.”84 A petition to the Department of Education
maintains that the resolutions negotiated with campuses lack teeth.
The Department is “all carrot and no stick.”85
D.

Reform Strategies
The first and most obvious strategy for combating campus
rape is to hold schools accountable for their failures. A step in that
direction is the proposed Campus Accountability and Safety Act,
which would require colleges and universities to
• designate confidential advisers to coordinate survivor
services;
• train campus personnel involved in sexual assault-related
services and procedures;
• no longer allow athletic departments or subgroups of students to handle complaints of sexual violence;
• coordinate efforts with local law enforcement agencies.
The bill would also fine schools up to one percent of their operating budget if they fail to investigate reports of sexual assault, and
increase penalties under the Clery Act to up to $150,000 per violation, up from the current level of $35,000.86 Even without federal
legislation, institutions should make such investigations a priority,
as a growing number are.87

[Vol. 23.1

Other proposals have been made to increase accountability
for campus rape. One would require the Department of Education
to conduct random reviews of colleges and universities to determine their compliance with Title IX mandates.88 To make that possible, Congress needs to authorize additional funding for the Office
of Civil Rights. Schools could also be required to conduct and publish annual surveys to assess the prevalence of sexual assault, the
number and results of disciplinary hearings, and the effectiveness of
remedial strategies. Such transparency would give schools a greater
incentive to address rape than the current regime, in which schools
that discourage rape reports appear to have a lower incidence of
problems. Providing independent advocates for victims of sexual
assault, as do California universities, is another way to empower
individuals to report rape and ensure an adequate institutional response.89 Federal policy could also require schools to involve local
law enforcement in the investigation of sexual assaults, while leaving victims with the choice of whether or not to pursue criminal
charges.90 Such a requirement, by ensuring an adequate inquiry,
would increase the likelihood that survivors will press charges.91
Schools should also provide more extensive education for
staff and students, including bystander intervention training, which
preliminary studies suggest is the most promising prevention approach.92 Giving individuals concrete strategies to help individuals
in high-risk situations increases the likelihood of productive interventions. Enlisting male campus leaders in prevention efforts can
also enhance their credibility.93 So too, institutions should also invest more resources in program evaluation. We know far too little
about what works to reduce sexual assaults.94 More sophisticated
victims).

assessment of multipronged preventive approaches should be a
priority.95
Prevention of alcohol abuse must also assume higher priority.
Every year, close to 100,000 students experience a sexual assault
while under the influence of alcohol.96 Traditionally, schools have
been reluctant to incorporate issues of alcohol abuse in rape prevention programs out of concern that victims will be blamed, and
blame themselves, for the assault.97 That needs to change. Warning
women that intoxication increases their risk of sexual assault does
not imply that they are responsible for it. Schools need to do a
better job of social messaging, cracking down on underage drinking, and creating attractive alcohol-free housing and recreational
options.98 As one Student Council president noted, “[t]oo many
people are too drunk too often.”99 Schools have a responsibility to
alter the culture that encourages the problem.
Another way to make institutions more accountable for their
response to sexual assault is through private lawsuits. Widely publicized litigation by students and alumni has led to significant reforms.100 For example, a lawsuit forced the University of Colorado
at Boulder to take responsibility for a football recruiting program

that encouraged sexual assault of female “[a]mbassadors” who were
expected to show recruits “a good time” while on campus.101 Other
lawsuits have resulted in large settlements against universities that
admitted athletes with a history of misconduct who went on to rape
women students.102 Gloria Allred has filed successful claims on behalf of women students at Occidental and the University of Connecticut, and has reached confidential settlements at other schools
without even filing lawsuits.103 Litigation would be an even more effective strategy if courts or Congress were to revisit the standard for
holding institutions liable. Currently, plaintiffs must show that the
school was “deliberately indifferent” to known risks of violence.104
A preferable approach would be to hold schools accountable for
negligent responses to student violence.105 Schools should also be
liable for failing to provide adequate procedural protections to students accused of sexual misconduct. Such protections should include notice, an opportunity to be heard, to cross-examine accusers
and witnesses, although not necessarily directly, and to have counsel or an advisor present at the proceedings.106
Another, more controversial strategy for change involves
broadening the definition of what constitutes an offense. Some
commentators believe that the law should require affirmative consent to sexual activity, as is currently required in the criminal codes
of three states, although they recognize assent through conduct as
well as through words.107 One possible approach would be to follow
Canada’s example, which requires “the voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.” Consent

is not present if “the accused induces the complainant to engage in
the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority.” Nor
does an accused have a defense of consent if the belief involved
“recklessness or wilful [sic] blindness,” or the accused did not take
“reasonable steps . . . to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.”108 California has adopted a similar approach. A 2014 “yes
means yes” law requires all schools that receive state funds for student financial assistance to set an “affirmative consent standard”
for adjudicating campus sexual assaults. That standard would define consent to sexual relations as an “affirmative, conscious, and
voluntary agreement” between the parties to engage in sexual activity.109 Silence or lack of resistance would not constitute consent.
Nor would acquiescence by someone who is unconscious or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol to the point where he or she “could
not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.”110
Consent must be ongoing and may be revoked at any time.111 New
York has recently changed its policies for the state university to define consent as an affirmative act that requires “clear, knowing and
voluntary” participation.112
Critics of this approach raise several concerns.113 As Yale law
professor Jed Rubenfeld notes, “[p]eople can and frequently do

have fully voluntary sex without communicating unambiguously;
under the new consent standards, that can be deemed rape if one
party later feels aggrieved.”114 And even under those standards,
parties would still engage in “he said, she said” battles over whether consent was freely given. Critics also object that an affirmative
consent standard is “very unlikely to deter predators or protect victims. Instead, its effect will be to codify vague and capricious rules
governing student conduct, to shift the burden of proof to (usually
male) students accused of sexual offenses, and to create a disturbing precedent for government regulation of consensual sex.”115 At
Harvard Law School, after the introduction of an affirmative consent standard, dozens of professors came out against the policy.116
The professors claimed the policy “is skewed against the accused,”
and lacks core procedural protections.117 Echoing the professors’
fear, one student noted “[i]t’s life-changing to have the label of rapist put on you.”118
Some of these concerns may be overstated. Consent can
include nonverbal cues such as body language or a passionate response to sexual overtures. And if the meaning of those cues is
ambiguous, there is reason to discourage sex. That is the best way
to change a culture in which non-consent is too often disregarded.
A yes means yes standard has the advantage of focusing parties’
attention on whether they both want the sexual experience they are
having.119 More than 800 campuses already operate with an affirmative consent requirement and no research suggests that the standard has proven unjust or unworkable.120 At the very least, as the
outside general counsel of Pomona College put it, the requirement

is “going to allow for greater discussion, understanding and clarity
on college campuses.”121
Yet proponents should not overestimate the extent to which
changing formal rules will solve the problems in sexual practices.
The wave of rape law reform that occurred in the late 1970s and
1980s, which was partly designed to make rape easier to prove in
court, did not in fact increase reporting, arrest, or conviction rates.122
Doctrinal change in the absence of shifts in cultural attitudes has
limited impact. But changing the legal standard is one way to affect
cultural norms. We need more experience and evaluation of “yes
means yes” on campuses to determine whether it can reduce the
risks of nonconsensual sexual conduct without posing undue risks
for innocent parties.
Equally critical are more media efforts to publicize the problem and encourage responsibility for the solution. The Obama administration has made major strides in this direction through an
advertising campaign titled “1 is 2 Many,” which emphasizes zero
tolerance for assault, and another titled “It’s on Us,” which urges
bystanders to do more to prevent sexual violence.123
To make all these changes possible, continued student activism is critical. The current wave of attention to campus rape has
been largely driven by survivors. Activists responded to the Toronto police chief’s comment about not dressing as sluts by staging “slutwalks” in more than seventy cities around the world, with
women dressed in bras, halter tops, and garter belts. Students at
the University of North Carolina, Yale, and Amherst were among
the early organizers of protests, a Facebook page, and groups like
Know Your IX and End Rape on Campus. They wrote articles, lobbied on Capitol Hill, filed Title IX complaints, and assisted others
in doing the same.124 As a result of such efforts, the number of Title IX complaints involving sexual violence has more than tripled
since 2009.125 The adverse publicity following students’ exposé of
rape cases has often prompted review and reform of campus sexual

III. Rape in the Military
The frequency of rape in the military has also attracted increased attention. Over the last quarter century, more than half a
million uniformed men and women have experienced rape or attempted rape.128 Reports of sexual assault and rape were up fifty
percent in 2013, and another eight percent in 2014.129 Only one
in four cases of sexual assault in 2014 was reported.130 Of the 5061
cases in 2013, only 484—less than one in ten—went to trial, and
only 376 resulted in convictions.131 In 2012, fewer than thirteen percent of some 26,000 assaults were reported and only 238 resulted in
convictions.132 An armed service member who sexually assaulted a
fellow service member had a ninety-two percent chance of avoiding a court martial.133 As an army nurse told the co-chair of a new
bipartisan caucus on military sexual assault, “I’m more afraid of my
own soldiers than I am of the enemy.”134 Her fears are well founded. At hearings before the House Committee on Oversight and
Reform, Representative Jane Harman noted that “women serving
in the U.S. military are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier
than killed by enemy fire in Iraq.”135

Rape on Campus

The problem is not confined to women. Of the estimated
26,000 cases of assaults in 2012, fifty-four percent were targeted at
men. Yet only 380 men reported their assault, and only 247 asked
for an investigation.136 Just twenty-eight percent of those cases proceeded to court martial.137 Male victims not only fear retaliation,
they also worry about being perceived or exposed as gay.138
A.

The Victimization of Victims
In principle, the military has long proclaimed “zero tolerance”
for sexual assault. In practice, it has often displayed zero tolerance
for the reporting of sexual assault. The re-victimization of victims
that is common in campus rape cases is also common in the military.
Service members who have been drinking before being assaulted
have been charged with drunk and disorderly conduct and conduct
unbecoming an officer, while their assailants escape sanctions.139 A
textbook case involved Stacey Thompson, a Marine corporal stationed in Japan who reported that her sergeant laced her drinks
with drugs and raped her. He was later allowed to leave the Marine Corps, and she was given an “other-than-honorable” discharge
stemming from drug use that night. As a consequence, she lost veteran’s benefits.140 In a similar scandal involving the Naval Academy, a complainant who reported a gang rape faced disciplinary
action for underage drinking; her alleged assailants, three Navy
football players, were permitted to complete their last season.141 In
another scandal involving the Naval Academy, a friend of a rape
complainant noted, “[a]ny girl at our school who turns in a guy is
gonna be crucified.”142 The experience of a pilot in a recent sexual

assault case bears that out. In the year following the conviction
of her assailant, she was passed over for promotion, professionally
“put on a shelf,” and socially isolated.143 In Department of Defense
studies, sixty-two percent of victims who reported sexual assault experienced retaliation, and that number has not been falling.144 The
risks of retaliation are especially great in military contexts because
survivors can’t exit the situation. Unlike most civilians, members of
the armed forces cannot simply quit their jobs to escape the abuse.
Other problems involve dismissive responses to complaints or
invasive questioning of rape victims, which is permitted in military
but not civilian proceedings.145 A Marine Lieutenant who reported
a rape was told that charges would not be pressed and was chastised, “you’re tough. You need to pick yourself up and dust yourself
off . . . . I can’t babysit you all of the time.”146 Another Marine who
was violently raped in a bathroom was told, “[d]on’t come bitching
to me because you had sex and changed your mind.”147 Victims
are also typically encouraged by prosecutors to submit to pretrial
interviews with defense counsel, a practice uncommon in civilian
contexts.148 Such questioning can be extremely intrusive and focus on matters of sexual history that bear little or no relevance to
the case.149

Rape on Campus

The problem is compounded in the military by a structure
that gives commanding officers the power to determine whether to
press charges and what sanctions to impose. All too often, that discretion has been skewed by favoritism toward the accused.150 According to statistics provided to Congress, commanders reduced as
many as a third of sexual abuse punishments.151 In two recent cases,
Air Force generals set aside jury convictions for sexual assault, in
one instance reasoning that the defendant could not be guilty because he was a “doting father and husband.”152 Sex offenders are
also given the option of resignation in lieu of court-martial; if they
admit guilt and leave the military, all charges are dropped.153
A number of recent incidents speak volumes about attitudes
at the upper levels of the military. In 2013, the officer in charge of
sexual assault prevention programs for the Air Force was arrested in a Virginia parking lot and charged with sexual battery.154 In
2014, the Army’s top sex-crimes prosecutor was reprimanded for
molesting a female officer at a sexual assault prevention conference.155 The Air Force’s sexual-assault prevention officer was also
reprimanded for fondling a woman in a bar against her will.156 That
same year, the Alaska Air National Guard’s commander was forced
to resign after a federal investigation issued a scathing report of
treatment of sexual assault victims. It found that complaints were
not properly documented, that victims were not referred to victim
advocates, that their confidentiality was breached, and that they
were ostracized by leaders and peers.157
Victims of military rapes also lack certain protections guaranteed to victims in civilian proceedings such as the right to submit
a statement in sentencing proceedings, or appear at a post-trial release hearing.158 The absence of such rights undermines the fact and
appearance of fairness in military justice.

Reform Strategies
In 2013, while commenting on the rising rate of assault complaints in the military, President Obama told reporters, “[t]he bottom line is, I have no tolerance for this. If we find out somebody’s
engaging in this stuff, they’ve got to be held accountable, prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably
discharged – period.”159 “Obama said he had instructed Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel ‘to step up our game exponentially.’”160
Recent reforms attempt to do just that. They include providing attorneys to victims, removing the authority of commanders to
overturn convictions, criminalizing retaliation against victims, and
requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault.161 Yet many believe that these changes are insufficient
to correct the core problem—the lack of impartiality and trust in the
process. As a Yale military law expert put it, the reforms are like “piling Band-Aids on a badly broken 18th-century museum piece.”162
The proposal that activists believe is most promising, creating an independent prosecutor to handle sex abuse cases, has been
blocked from coming to a floor vote despite having a majority of
Senators’ support.163 The military opposes the proposed legislation.164 According to General Raymond T. Odierno, Chief of Staff
of the Army, removing responsibility for sexual assault from commanders would “undermine the readiness of the force. It will inhibit our commanders’ ability to shape the climate and discipline of
our units. Most importantly, it will hamper the timely delivery of

justice to the very people we wish to help, the victims and survivors
of these horrific crimes.”165 However, supporters of the legislation
point out that commanders have repeatedly proven themselves incapable of creating trust among victims that would encourage the
reporting and prosecution of sexual assault. As Senator Rand Paul
put it, “[t]he definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different result.”166 Senator Kristen Gillibrand pointed out that allies such as Israel, the United Kingdom,
Germany, and Australia had all taken sexual assault cases out of
the chain of command, and in Israel, reporting had increased eighty
percent.167 Supporters of such reforms in this country are exploring
other tactics to force passage.168
Another promising proposal was the Furthering Accountability and Individual Rights within the Military Act (“The Fair Military Act”).169 It would have limited the use of the “good soldier”
defense, which allows defendants to cite unrelated factors during
trial, such as their prior military record, as a defense against sexual
assault charges.170 In addition, the legislation would have required
assessments of commanders concerning sexual assault prevention.
They would be evaluated on their ability to handle reports of sexual assault, and to create a climate where victims can report without fear of retaliation.171 The bill would have also extended sexual
assault prevention measures to military service academies. The
Fair Military Act died in committee before making it through the
House.172 A similar bill, the Victim’s Protection Act of 2014, passed

the Senate in a rare unanimous vote, but it too failed to make it
through the House.174
One other possible reform would be to allow victims of sexual assault to sue under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Civil
Rights Act. Civilians can now sue under these statutes for employers’ failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent assault or retaliation against those who report it; members of the armed forces
have no such right.175 The American Civil Liberties Union and the
Service Women’s Action Network have proposed extending this
right to military personnel as a way to increase pressure for cultural
change.176 The publicity accompanying such lawsuits could provide
a powerful incentive for reform.
A strategy for moving such reforms forward is the continued
work of activist groups such as Protect our Defenders and Service
Women’s Action Network in publicizing abuses and lobbying for
change. The media has been a crucial ally in that endeavor. “The
Invisible War,” a documentary about sexual assault in the military,
helped galvanize support for reforms and raise consciousness within the military.177 Two days after seeing the film, former Secretary of
Defense Leon Panetta announced that more senior officers would
handle sexual assault complaints.178 Additional publicity could provide needed leverage for change. Such efforts can attract attention

for other necessary strategies, such as building more robust protection for victims and guaranteeing their right to be heard in proceedings arising from their assault.179 More attention also should be
paid to male victims of sexual violence, who are frequently neglected in prevention and support services.180 “For the past 25 years,”
noted Senator Gillibrand, “we’ve had the military telling us that
there’s zero tolerance for sexual assault. And all we’ve seen is zero
accountability.”181 This has to change.
IV. Conclusion
Rape on campus and in military institutions reflects broader
cultural dynamics requiring broader cultural change. It is critical
to challenge the messages that eroticize male violence and perpetuate sexual double standards, as well as marginalize male victims.
Sexual assault is normalized in movies, on television, and in video
games.182 The labeling of boys as “studs” and girls as “sluts” begins
at early ages and fosters sexual miscommunication. When women
feel pressure to fake resistance in order to avoid seeming promiscuous, men will feel entitled to disregard it, and the dangers of unjust accusations and coercive sex will persist. We urgently need to
challenge these cultural dynamics through educational and media
strategies. The stakes in this agenda are substantial, not only for the
appalling number of individuals who experience rape, but also for
the still far greater number of individuals who fear it and limit their
lives to avoid it.
