USE YOUR PERSONAL LIE DETECTOR
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH
Laura E. Gómez*1
How should we judge Brett Kavanaugh’s denials about sexual misbehavior? We can run his assertions through our personal lie
detectors, which we all possess based on our life experiences.
I find myself doubting Kavanaugh’s truthfulness about what
happened to Christine Blasey Ford because I doubt his veracity
about something that has gotten lost in the latest news: his testimony during the confirmation hearings when asked about the sexual
improprieties of one of his mentors, retired Judge Alex Kozinski of
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Last year, fifteen women came forward to say Kozinski had
harassed them physically or verbally over his four decades as a
federal judge.2 Kozinski chose retirement rather than face an investigation into the allegations.3 Asked repeatedly by both Republican

and Democrat senators about his knowledge of Kozinski’s bad acts,
Kavanaugh said he never witnessed Kozinski “engaging in inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.”4 Along with his insistence that
he never assaulted a younger girl when he was 17, these denials lead
me to question Kavanaugh’s inclination to treat women as the full
equals of men under the law.
I first met Kozinski in summer 1992, when I began a clerkship with a different judge on the appeals court.5 Kavanaugh had
completed his clerkship in the intimate Pasadena courthouse just
as mine started.
My interactions with Kozinski were comparatively minimal
and involved no inappropriate behavior on Kozinski’s part, but I
did my best to spend as little time around him as possible. He had
what I’ll call a creepiness factor—an older male authority-figure
who expressed too much interest in the young women around him.
It is hard for me to imagine that any of the judge’s clerks would not
have known of reactions like mine, which were commonplace.6
Kavanaugh was one of Kozinski’s star clerks. Kozinski
helped him land a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy. Within a decade, Kavanaugh was appointed a federal
judge; then in 2006, President George W. Bush appointed him to
the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, making him an equal of
his mentor.

Kavanaugh couldn’t possibly have missed the furor over
reporting about Kozinski’s questionable behavior in the Los
Angeles Times in 2008.7 According to what Kozinski told the
Times, he had maintained “for years” a website filled with sexually
explicit images, and he had invited “friends” to view the images. Kozinski described what he uploaded to the site as “funny”
and “interesting.” They included a video of a woman shaving her
pubic area and a photo of a naked woman on all fours painted to
look like a cow.
It simply doesn’t ring true to me that, as he asserted during
the confirmation process, Kavanaugh would be in the dark about
allegations of impropriety related to Kozinski. But in response to a
question from Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Kavanaugh wrote:
To the best of my memory, no one ever raised concerns with
me regarding inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature on
the part of Judge Kozinski. Judge Kozinski worked in a small
courthouse in Pasadena with ten other judges, numerous law
clerks, and court employees. Apparently, none of them knew
of any misconduct, or they presumably would have reported it.8

8. Questions for the Record, supra note 4, at 157 (questions of Sen.
Coons, Member of Sen. Comm. on the Judiciary). First, empirical evidence
suggests that much harassment, in fact, is not reported. A report by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission estimates 70 percent of employees who say they experienced workplace sexual harassment did not report
it, oftentimes out of fear of retaliation or concern their superiors would not
believe them. See U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, Report of the CoChairs of the Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace (2016), available at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/

Ford’s account does not strike me as nearly as far-fetched as Kavanaugh’s denials about Kozinski’s behavior.
Based on Kavanaugh’s senior-year yearbook, his all-boys Catholic school, Georgetown Prep, featured a culture of heavy drinking
and misogyny. Photo captions brag about partying (“100 Kegs or
Bust”) and make cringe-worthy jokes about violence against women
(“Do these guys beat their wives?”).9 Georgetown Prep graduate
Mark Judge, whom Ford implicates, along with Kavanaugh, in her
assault, wrote a memoir of his debauched high school days, including
drinking with a buddy he called “Bart O’Kavanaugh.”10
Had Ford gone to the police at the time with her story, authorities would have taken it seriously.11 She describes a house party
where everyone was engaged in illegal, underage drinking, an
aggravating factor under the law. Two older boys together pushed
her into a bedroom, which could be seen as conspiracy to commit a
under-reported given the manner in which the Senate Judiciary Committee
in 1991 received Professor Anita Hill’s complaints of sexual harassment by
her boss Clarence Thomas. See generally Julia Jacobs, Anita Hill’s Testimony and Other Key Moments From the Clarence Thomas Hearings, N.Y. Times

crime. One of them clawed at her clothes and kept her from screaming with his hand over her mouth. She says she feared for her life.12
Against Ford’s memory, we have seen a line-up of Kavanaugh’s
former female clerks testifying to his outstanding mentorship.13 In
addition, 65 women who “knew Brett well” in high school signed a
letter attesting to his decency.14 On the personal side, stories about
his devotion to his daughters, including coaching his older daughter’s basketball team, likewise affirm him as an enlightened father
who seeks to give his girls equal opportunities.15

Ford’s complaint with some rigor since, if they were true, they could support
the crimes of statutory rape, forcible rape, aggravated assault, and kidnapping.
Indeed, around the time Ford alleges she was raped by Kavanaugh, Maryland’s
law of forcible rape was undergoing a dramatic shift from the traditional standard of force requiring “a reasonable fear which overcame [the victim’s] ability
to resist” to the post-women’s liberation standard of force as “the reasonableness of [the victim’s] apprehension of fear” to be decided by the jury. State v.

of Rusk and Rape Reform, in Criminal Law Stories 171, 171–72 (Donna Coker

the cusp of legal transformation, when sexual behavior that had been commonplace and tolerated by the law was rapidly being recast as criminal. The story of
State v. Rusk is the story of when and how a set of social norms of sex and dating
became unacceptable.”).

But I can’t help connecting the dots between a boys-will-beboys high school culture, socialization into the legal profession by
a ribald mentor, and what appears to be a convenient, willful blindness to that mentor’s obvious missteps. Perhaps Kavanaugh can’t
identify harassment, and possibly assault, or he doesn’t want to.
Either way, I don’t trust him to protect women’s rights.
