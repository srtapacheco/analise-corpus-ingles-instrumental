Abstract

There has been a distinct rise in sexual assault allegations
within the entertainment industry in recent years. The culture of
the industry, the nature of entertainment contracts, and the abuse
of the nondisclosure agreement are to blame for this rampant abuse
of vulnerable entertainers. This Article focuses on the contractual
prisons in which sexually abused entertainers find themselves when
they attempt to part ways with their employers. Using prevailing
equitable remedies in conjunction with the feminist contract theory
of context and subjectivity can help alleviate some of the pressure on abused entertainers attempting to “breach” their contracts.
While Title VII has been used in the employment law context, it
has yet to be applied in the context of entertainment contracts.
Using this novel approach, Title VII can put entertainment-based

Introduction
“I would rather let the truth ruin my career than lie for a m
­ onster
ever again.”3

Imagine for a moment that you are a brand new pop star. You
are fifteen years old,4 you can sing, and you are a woman. Imagine walking into the recording studio for the first time. You see the
brightly colored walls lined with platinum records and posters of
the musicians you have been listening to your whole life. You can
hear the blood in your ears as each foot plants itself on the beautifully designed carpet. It is now your turn to be famous. You enter a
room with a table full of suited men and women. You are with your
mom, or, if you are lucky, with your agent. You sit for hours, listening to the lawyers talk about your new contract, watching them
negotiate, hearing everything but digesting nothing. You are going
to be a star. You agree to the terms because you cannot imagine a
scenario in which these clauses would mean actual problems down
the road. You agree because without your signature, without your
pledge, you are just another fifteen-year-old girl.
Fast-forward ten years and you are now successful, famous,
and in trouble. Your music producer took a young, naïve fifteenyear-old and manipulated and abused her. Your contract traded
your childhood for assault. Now imagine you try to free yourself
from these destructive experiences. You sue your record label, begging them to let you free of your contract, begging them to free

lied about being raped.6 You refuse, and the court finds that your
contract, signed at age fifteen in a room full of lawyers when you
had nothing but dreams in your eyes, was “heavily negotiated,”
and refuses to allow you out of it.7 Your rapist then sues you for
defamation.8
Now imagine you are a similar pop star with impressive international success. When a fan, who is also an industry insider, sticks
his hand up your dress at a meet-and-greet, you ask his employer to
reprimand him as he sees fit.9 This fan’s boss decides to fire him, as
this fan’s job is to represent the company at various events where
musicians are present. This fan sues you.10 You are now being
sued for “lying” about being sexually assaulted during a contracted
meet-and-greet with your fans.
Alternatively, envision yourself as a TV personality, contracted with a network to be the face of the station.11 You are a
young, beautiful woman who reports on sporting events, interviews
athletes and coaches, and provides interesting and important information for sports fans nationally. On several of your work trips
you stay in hotels to best perform your job. Now imagine you are
in your private room and a stalker has paid your hotel to look the
other way so he is able to take lewd videos of you without your
consent.12 This man then leaks these videos, horribly embarrass5. Complaint at 6–7, Sebert v. Gottwald, BC 560466 (Cal. Super. Ct. Oct.

interview stating you had nothing to do with the making and distribution of these videos as a prerequisite to coming back to work.14
You have now been stalked, assaulted, and forced to talk about it
publicly under threat of losing your job.
These stories are more than just imaginary for many female
entertainers. In fact, these scenarios are based on three women’s
experiences in just the last few years.15 Sexually-based offenses within the entertainment industry uniquely affect women and
imprison them within contract clauses. Moreover, courts allow
these women to remain victims of contractual relationships with
their abusers.
As attorneys and judges, however, we can protect these
women by rethinking our approach to the contracts that constrict
them. By identifying the point of contract breach not as the victim’s actions, but rather as the predator’s intentional sexual tort,
we can allow women in these positions more freedom. Using this
method, courts should identify the breach not as the time at which
female entertainers try to end the contract, no matter how “heavily
negotiated”16 it may be, but instead, as the moment the other party
breaches their duty of care to the entertainer.

This Article proceeds as follows. Part I explores the background of the entertainment industry’s struggle with a culture of
sexual assault. Part II considers intentional sexual torts including
rape, sexual assault, and domestic abuse. Part III describes basic
employment contract law and the provisions unique to the entertainment industry. Part IV explains the need to apply feminist legal
theory to contract law remedies. Lastly, Part V analyzes how situating an intentional tort as the genesis for the breach of contract will
impact this serious issue of female entertainers experiencing contractual imprisonment.

I.

Problems in the Entertainment Industry

The entertainment industry (Industry) consists of various
markets: film, television, music, publishing, art, sports, and more.
Damian Bazadona, president and founder of Situation Interactive, a marketing service for all facets of the Industry, said, “Early
mornings. Late nights. Rehearsals, walk-throughs, presentations.
Uptown, downtown . . . . [a] single day in this business can take
you all over the city, at all hours.”17 The tumultuous and adventurous nature of the Industry in both music and film creates situations
that normal 9am-to-5pm work arrangements do not. The Industry
employs cameramen, directors, actors, support staff, drivers, scouts,
producers, editors, singers, artists, and many other employees. These
various employment opportunities create a melting pot of cultures
and experiences.18 It is this same energetic, competitive, aggressive, passionate, and frightening atmosphere that feeds the culture
of sexual assault within the Industry. This Subpart discusses the
ingrained culture of sexual assault by Industry men like Bill Cosby,
Harvey Weinstein, and Dr. Luke, and how the Industry further victimizes survivors of sexual assault by empowering these predators.
A.

The Culture of Sexual Assault Against Female Entertainers
There are many notable examples of sexual abuse within the Industry;19 however, three of the most recent and egregious

examples are the ongoing legal battles against Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and Luke Gottwald (Dr. Luke).20 These men have
used their power and influence to frighten women into submitting
sexually, staying quiet after sexual abuse, and maintaining their
contractual agreements with them, regardless of the abusive nature
of their relationship. The case against Bill Cosby presents an example of coworker assault, Harvey Weinstein presents an example of
hybrid supervisor/industry tycoon assault, and Dr. Luke presents
the quintessential example of supervisor assault.
As he is one of America’s most beloved actors and comedians, fans were shocked to hear about Bill Cosby’s first sexual
assault allegation when it surfaced in early 2005, brought to light
by Andrea Constand.21 This, however, was not Cosby’s first sexual assault.22 According to later accusers, he began preying on
women almost forty years prior when he raped Sunni Wells after
comedian), and Donald Trump (President of the United States, and former reality TV star) have all been accused of sexual assault or misconduct. See Kristen

the decades between 1965 and 2008.24 With several dozen women
coming forward alleging sexual assault causing no damage to Bill
Cosby’s exceptionally successful career,25 this paints another clear
picture of the institutional complicity in powerful men’s abuses of
female entertainers.26
Bill Cosby was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
in 2002.27 This means with almost forty years of abuse under his
belt, President George W. Bush nominated and awarded Bill Cosby
what President Barack Obama called, “our nation’s highest civilian honor . . . a tribute to the idea that all of us, no matter where
we come from, have the opportunity to change this country for the
better.”28 Additionally, seven years later, in 2009, Cosby received

the Mark Twain Prize for “distinguished achievements in humor.”29
A year later, in 2010, Cosby received the Marian Anderson Award
to honor him for his positive impact to society.30 These awards honored and sanctified a rapist.
Fortunately, the 80-year-old Bill Cosby has seen the end of
his Hollywood career.31 His age, paired with the guilty verdict
for “three counts of aggravated indecent assault,” stemming from
Andrea Constand’s case, makes it impossible that Cosby will be
able to reenter the Industry.32 This comes as a small consolation as
the Industry attempts to move forward and change.
As proven by the #MeToo movement, Bill Cosby is not the
only Hollywood sexual predator. “If Harvey Weinstein invites you
to a private party in the Four Seasons, don’t go,”33 Courtney Love
said in a red carpet interview in 2005.34 She is not the only one
who spoke out about Weinstein’s abusive behavior towards female
entertainers in the Industry.35 Men and women alike joked about

years. Nevertheless, these sexual assault allegations only recently
warranted a front-and-center scandal.36 Armed with on-the-record
recounts from actresses and employees, evidence of Weinstein’s
legal team’s efforts to silence survivors of sexual assault, and even
audio of Weinstein repeatedly soliciting a woman captured during
a police sting, stories in the New York Times and New Yorker have
finally changed the narrative around Harvey Weinstein to expose
him as a predator.37
Weinstein’s ability to maintain this lifestyle of power, rape, and
assault, amid his very public presence, evidences that the Industry
as a whole fosters the abuse. Weinstein abused women openly for
almost fifty years,38 while jokes about his interactions with women
were shrugged off as Mad Men-esque.39
One positive to come of the unveiling of Weinstein is that his
film company, The Weinstein Company, was looking at filing for
bankruptcy in February 2018.40 However, instead of the tragic loss
of thousands of jobs and a film company crumbling, in an empowering move Businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet led a female
board of investors to purchase and redirect the company.41 While
Weinstein will never work in the Industry again, it is comforting to
know that the people he once preyed on will run his company.

“All the Truth I Could Tell”

While music producer Dr. Luke may not have multitudes of
women pointing the finger, Kesha Sebert (known professionally
as “Kesha”) has claimed that he sexually, mentally, and emotionally abused her for several years, which almost caused the loss of
her life.42 While this is not direct evidence of Dr. Luke’s wrongdoing, it is clear artists in the Industry readily believe Kesha’s claims
against him. With Dr. Luke’s connection to so many artists, one
would hope that other artists would come to Kesha’s aid, or open
up about their own abuse. While no other artists have come forward with allegations of abuse by Dr. Luke, there are several artists
who work with Dr. Luke who spoke out in support of Kesha.43
Kelly Clarkson wrote, “Trying 2 not say anything since I can’t say
anything nice about a person . . . so this is me not talking about Dr.
Luke.”44 Miley Cyrus wrote, “KESHA - I AM SO ANGRY FOR
YOU. THEY WERE WRONG. I’M SORRY.”45 Although Taylor
Swift does not work directly with Dr. Luke, she donated $250,000
to Kesha for her legal fees with a message of support after she lost
her initial injunction suit.46
Despite being in active litigation with one of his artists, Dr.
Luke was able to keep his job at Sony until very recently.47 His
self-created label, Kemosabe Records, which is now a subsidiary of
Sony, has a new CEO, but the implication is clear: Sony was not able
to do anything about Dr. Luke’s likely sexual abuse of one of their
contracted artists, while many in the industry stood by appalled.48

that he could maintain complete control over her life and career.”).

After the litigation with Kesha, Dr. Luke’s name and reputation has been all but destroyed. Due to the nature of Dr. Luke’s
success, the only way he could maintain his career is to do what
made him rise to the top to begin with: “rel[y] upon singers to get
his music heard by the masses.”49 With the reaction by artists like
Pink, it seems unlikely that many artists going forward would be
willing to attach their reputation and names to Dr. Luke, thereby
sealing his career in the Industry.50

The Reality of the Sexually Abused Entertainer

“It happens so frequently that it’s just the functioning normal.”51 There are dozens of known female entertainers who have
survived sexual abuse in the Industry, including many of Weinstein
and Cosby’s victims.52 This Subpart examines Taylor Swift’s, Erin
Andrews’s, and Kesha Sebert’s experiences in the spotlight regarding their claims of sexual assault and the legal battles that ensued
thereafter.53 The backlash that female entertainers experience after
coming forward about their assaults demonstrates that the Industry prefers to keep this behavior in the dark, and that the Industry
often sides with the abusers against the abused. Taylor Swift’s case
illustrates how Industry women are abused, Erin Andrews’ case
illustrates how, after the initial abuse, Industry women are abused
again by their employers’ policies, and lastly, Kesha’s case illustrates the clearest example of artist and supervisor assault.
In 2013, Taylor Swift attended a fan meet-and-greet at one of
her concerts.54 During the meet-and-greet, David Mueller, a radio
DJ, reached his hand up the back of Swift’s dress and “grabb[ed

Mueller was consequently let go due to the inconsistency of his story.56 In response, Mueller sued Swift for tortious interference with
his employment contract.57 In her countersuit, Swift sued Mueller
for sexual assault and sought damages in the amount of $1. During
the trial, the plaintiff’s attorney probed Swift about potentially lying
about her assault.58 After a jury trial and a four-hour deliberation,
the jury found for Swift and awarded her $1.

and arrived early to retrofit Andrews’ door peephole so he could
videotape her once she had exited the shower.61 Barrett used his
cell phone to videotape Andrews naked while dressing, and posted the tapes on the Internet even after learning he could not be
compensated monetarily.62 After the videos surfaced, Andrews’
employer, ESPN, forced Andrews to sit for an interview dispelling
rumors that she was complicit in the assault as a publicity stunt.63
The Washington Post found ESPN’s forced interview callous, saying
ESPN “comes off as unsympathetic, at the very least, to an employee dealing with an extremely upsetting, ongoing situation, as well as
unwilling to grant her the benefit of the doubt.”64 Not only was Erin
Andrews assaulted by someone stalking her, violating her privacy,
and then humiliating her by posting her naked body on the Internet
without her consent, but then her employer demanded she confront
the claims on public television and attest she did not have a hand in
her own assault. This is a classic example of how victims are blamed
for their assaults and then shamed for them.
Luckily, and atypically, Andrews was able to successfully
sue the hotels (Blackwell and Marriot) for negligence, “negligent
infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy,”65 as well
as Michael Barrett for “negligence, invasion of privacy (intrusion
of seclusion and public disclosure of private facts) and intentional infliction of emotional distress.”66 She was awarded a

Rosemary Patricia Sebert (Pebe) is Kesha’s mother and coauthor of several top hit songs, soundtracks, and screenplays.68 Pebe
claims Kesha experienced “sexual and drug-related abuse,”69 at the
hands of her producer, Dr. Luke. These allegations came during a
power struggle over Kesha’s contract terms, and whether the singer should be held to the original agreement, as “she could have
greater artistic and financial success with another record label and
publishing company.”70 After trying to break ties with Gottwald,
Kesha’s mother sent emails out to “various people, including some
in New York,” that detailed the sexual and drug abuse allegations
involving Kesha.71
In response, Dr. Luke retaliated by filing suit alleging defamation and tortious interference with contract by Kesha and Pebe
Sebert (and others), claiming that after he made “Kesha, a previously unknown artist into a star, Pebe . . . tortiously induced her to
breach.”72 This and the accompanying suits have been lingering in
the judicial system for years. Because Dr. Luke was sued in his official capacity as a producer of Sony, he was able to use Industry funds
and representation to defend against Kesha’s claims. Kesha, functionally an unemployed artist, held the financial burden of her legal
representation alone (although Taylor Swift did donate $250,000
to Kesha to aid in legal fees).73 This is a clear picture of economic duress that entertainers face in the Industry. It was and still is
essentially a waiting game—who will have the last dollar to spend?
Sexual assault in the Industry is pervasive. While many
female entertainers have taken steps to litigate against their abusers, their results have varied. Part II will discuss some of the tort
claims available to survivors to seek recompense against their abusers, and discusses the pros and cons of litigating such claims.

Intentional Sexual Torts

There are several different types of intentional torts under the
law: rape, sexual assault, and sexual battery. Title VII protects those
who experience these sexual torts in the workplace by establishing
a duty to maintain a safe work environment free from harassment
and assault, and declares standards on the policies and procedures

necessary to combat them when they occur. To further that goal, the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) adopted a
new code against sexual harassment under Title VII. In it, harassment is defined as any “[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature . . . .”74 Such conduct places employees into a quid pro quo
situation, in which the employee becomes concerned for her job
security if she refuses to comply with her assaulter’s wishes.75 These
incidents can also “unreasonably interfer[e] with an individual’s
work performance or creat[e] an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.”76 This provision references both verbal and
physical advances and conduct and includes both sexual harassment and sexual assault.77 Therefore, Title VII protects employees
from both harassment and assault by their supervisors. In turn, Title
VII is an ally and a protection for entertainers in the Industry both
from verbal abuse as well as physical abuse from their supervisors
on set, in the record room, and in other situations. While there are
many different intentional torts, this Subpart will focus on sexual
torts most pertinent to abuse within the Industry; specifically, sexual assault, sexual battery, and rape by those in positions of power.

across all industries are increasingly cognizant of sexual harassment and assault that may occur in the workplace, and many have
taken affirmative steps to deal with these issues. The United States
military, for example, has created their own departments to deal
exclusively with intentional sexual torts occurring during soldiers’
employment.79 From the American military to waitresses at restaurants, men and women are victims of intentional sexual torts while
performing their jobs.80 Title VII is incredibly important because
it formalizes the responsibilities of the employer to create a safe
place for its employees.
1.

Employer’s Duty of Care Under Title VII

An employer has a duty of care under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 to establish and maintain a safe working environment for all employees.81 This means that record labels, film
companies, and all other employers have a duty to ensure safety
in the work environment, including safety from sexual assault and
harassment.
In creating this duty on the employers, Title VII has benefitted the American workplace.82 Title VII has created a pathway for

nature of the business to protect the employee from the hazards incident to it,
and the employer is further bound to exercise this degree of diligence in providing an employee with safe tools, appliances, machinery, and working places.”

survivors to bring suits in federal court and provides them with all
the benefits that federal courts bring (safety from state law and jury
biases).83 Title VII also makes establishing a case for sexual assault
and harassment easier on the survivor by allowing the survivor to
bring data or testimony regarding incidents or company policies.84
Title VII has officially imposed this duty on the employer,
which aims to reduce women’s fears that their claims of sexual harassment or assault will be dismissed. Catherine MacKinnon, a leading
feminist legal theorist, stated in her article, Sexual Harassment Of
Working Women, “[R]ecovery was usually denied because . . . there
was no harm in just asking for sex . . . [courts] considered sexual
advances made by one employee to another . . . merely personal
conduct . . . not employment related.”85 Title VII is an important
protection for abused employees, and it should be utilized within
the industry to protect entertainers as well.
2.

Vicarious Liability

Vicarious liability necessitates that the factfinder “look to the
person higher up.”86 Whoever employs the intentional tortfeasor is
liable for the tortfeasor’s actions.87 A corporation is liable for dambecause employers are in the best position to carry the burden—to stop harassment before it starts, by educating employees, by providing avenues of redress,
and by holding harassing employees accountable for their actions.”).
83. Id. at 588. “First, it allows individuals the opportunity to take up a
cause of action in federal court and consequently avoid strict state law and
possible prejudice from state court juries.” Id.
84. Id. “Second, its procedural rules are traditionally structured to work
in favor of the plaintiff by lessening the plaintiff’s burden of establishing the
prima facie case. Instead of meeting the difficult requirement of invidious intent, plaintiffs only need to present quantitative data or testimony about particular events or the discriminatory character of questionable policies.” Id. This is
a huge step forward, as the problem within the Industry turns on whether or not
the abused entertainer is able to provide enough evidence to show they meet
the elements under Title VII to gain the benefits.
85. Id. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
based the change in Title VII on Catherine MacKinnon’s work. Id. at 588 (citing Catherine A. Mackinnon, Sexual Harassment of Working Women, 1

ages if they were “reckless in employing or retaining the agent, or
the agent was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting in
the scope of employment.”88 With vicarious liability, the entertainer
who might have become a defendant in a contract breach suit can
become the plaintiff in such suit by attaching the film company or
record label to the assailant’s intentional tort.
While some courts have held that vicarious liability will not
attach for sexual harassment or assault,89 plaintiffs have been successful in proving that the employer is vicariously liable by showing
the employer “adopted or ratified the tortuous conduct of its supervisory employees.”90 Ratification is proven by the plaintiff showing
the employer had “actual knowledge” of any sexual harassment or
assault. The plaintiff must additionally show that upon this actual
knowledge, the employer knew it was considered a tort, and that
the employer did not remedy the situation appropriately.91
In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, the court stated that once
a supervisor of an employee commits a sexual assault or shows discrimination against said employee, the employer would become
liable under Title VII.92 However, employers have a safety net:
behavior, and (b) that employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any
preventive or corrective opportunities provided by employer or to avoid harm
otherwise.”). See U.S. Equal Employment.

Title VII looks to the “reasonableness” of both their prevention
policies and their reaction when an employee reports an assault or
harassment.93
In Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, the court decided that if a
direct supervisor created an “actionable hostile environment” the
employer would be vicariously liable for the supervisor’s behavior.94 Sometimes, however, there are situations where employees
have been victimized despite no tangibly observable job repercussions, meaning survivors cannot point to specific instances where
their experience at work has been negatively impacted (demotions
at work, decrease in opportunities, decrease in pay, or even termination). In these instances, employers can raise an “affirmative
defense to liability or damages,” which can protect them from Title
VII ramifications.95 This affirmative defense requires a showing of
“reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly” any behavior
that could be deemed sexually harassing, in addition to an employee not utilizing any institutional remedies for the situation.96
Therefore, Title VII allows employers to become vicariously
liable for the actions of their employees, especially if they are in
positions of management, direct supervisory positions, or positions
of authority, even if the employee did not suffer any actual damages to their employment.
The EEOC states that vicarious liability attaches when “1) an
employer is responsible for the acts of its supervisors, and 2) employers should be encouraged to prevent harassment and employees
should be encouraged to avoid . . . the harm from harassment.”97
In order for the employer to avoid vicarious liability for supervisor
affirmative defense that looks to the reasonableness of employer’s conduct in
seeking to prevent and correct harassing conduct and to the reasonableness of
employee’s conduct in seeking to avoid harm.”).

in those cases in which employee has suffered no tangible job consequences as
result of supervisor’s actions, employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages; and (3) affirmative defense requires employer to show that it
exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and that employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any
preventive or corrective opportunities provided or to avoid harm otherwise.”).

harassment and assault, the employer had to take “reasonable care
to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and the
employee . . . failed to take . . . preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.”98
Therefore, unless film companies and record labels are implementing policies that are proactive and “corrective,” they could face
vicarious liability claims any time someone like Dr. Luke engages
in sexually harassing or assaultive behavior. If there is no policy,
there can be no exhaustion of administrative relief, and arguably
they did not take “reasonable care” to stop harassment and assault.
B.

Title VII and Sexual Assault Reporting in the Age of Celebrity
Gossip

Social media perpetuates it, people gossip about it, and everyone thinks it: “Why are they coming out now?” “Seems political.”
So why do women come out at what some might consider “opportune” times? Why do survivors not come forward about their
assault immediately after it happens? There are several reasons,
mostly personal, as to why a victim might or might not come forward about an assault.
1.

Survivor Reporting

Survivors often retreat to their own worlds when abused.
More often than not, survivors do not report their abuse to authorities.99 In fact, when abuse is committed within the confines of an
intimate relationship, only one-quarter of survivors report their
assault.100 When it is committed within the bounds of a friendship, no more than 40 percent of survivors reported the incident.101
Promisingly, however, when the assault is perpetrated by a stranger, survivors will report the incident up to 66 percent of the time.102
In the workplace, statistics show that 38 percent of women

assaults are reported.”).

experienced sexual harassment while at work.103 More specifically, in the Industry, “94% of the 843 women surveyed by USA
TODAY who work in the entertainment industry say they’ve experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault.”104 In fact, the
Industry has an even smaller report rate than the normal populace.
Approximately 25 percent of abused entertainers in the Industry
will report their assault to someone for a deep-seated fear of reprisal—including loss of job or even worse, loss of career.105 These
statistics convey that just because survivors are not reporting does
not mean crimes are not being committed. It often takes a long
time for a survivor to process the abuse they have suffered.106 This
healing and processing time often comes into stark contrast with
allotted statute of limitations available for survivors to bring claims
against their abuser.
There are several reasons that survivors might not come
forward immediately: denial, fear of the consequences, low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, a history of being
sexually violated, lack of information, disbelief, dissociation, or
even forcible drug use.107 There are also several reasons as to why
a survivor would come forward when a politician or celebrity finds
themselves in the media again.108 There are at least fourteen reasons why a survivor of assault would come forward now as opposed
to earlier, and in the Industry the most relevant include: (1) distance,
(2) knowledge of other survivors or freedom from fear, (3) empathic response or triggered by a contemporary incident, (4) knowledge
of no end to the statute of limitations, (5) emotional support from
others, (6) therapy-induced revelations, (7) triggered by an encounter with their abuser, (8) concern for others’ interaction with their

abuser, (9) exhaustion, and (10) realization that they are not the
one who should be ashamed.109
There are also current examples of why women will not come
forward, even now.110 It is not usually a media ploy or a political
move, nor even false confessions of abuse that drive these women
to come forward. The psychological damage abuse wages on survivors can be blamed for timing. And really, it is no one’s business
when a survivor comes forward.
2.

Statute of Limitations

The statute of limitations for sexual crimes varies depending
on the crime and the location. In California, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against a minor toll once
the survivor turns 28 years old.111 Therefore, the survivor has the
remainder of their adolescence plus ten years to come to terms with
their assault and to come forward with their abuser’s name. The
statute of limitations for rape in California is ten years.112 In New
York, the statute of limitations for rape, criminal sexual acts, aggravated sexual abuse, and course of sexual conduct against a child
does not exist. Survivors of these types of abuse may come forward at any time to press charges against their abusers.113 For other
sexual offenses considered felonies in New York, the statute of limitations is five years.114
Essentially, the two most notable places for the Industry have
very different statutes of limitations for sexual crimes. If an artist
travels with their supervisor and is abused in different locations,
these varying limitations are actually a blessing. Several jurisdictions mean several statutes of limitations, allowing criminal charges
to be pressed against an abuser in one jurisdiction with longer

III. The Entertainment Contract
The most important part of the system of oppression in the
Industry is the enforcement of an entertainment contract (Contract). The Contract allows men and companies to oppress,
imprison, and abuse women in the Industry through their employment provisions, payment structures, and general requirements.
This Part discusses the Contract as a tool of oppression, focusing on
what the Contract looks like in film and television as compared to
normal employment contracts.
A.

Entertainment as Employment
At its most essential, the Contract provides for the services of
the entertainer. Therefore, it is an employment contract. This Subpart addresses traditional employment contracts and radio and film
entertainment contracts.
1.

Employment Contracts

Many jobs in this country are considered “at-will” employment.115 However, there are several types of jobs that require
contractual arrangements. Due to the normalcy of the 9-to-5 job, this
Subpart outlines what are considered “normal” employment terms so
as to facilitate the argument that employment contracts differ from
entertainment contracts, as shown in Subpart III.A.2.b. Standard
employment contracts include many clauses, relevant ones including:
agreed-upon compensation; grounds for termination; any noncompete clause; choice of laws clauses; option for counsel; a statement of
entire contractual agreement; and a severability clause.116
The compensation clause outlines the agreed-upon payment to
the employee for services rendered to the employer under the terms

30, 2017), https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/employment-at-will-definition-30022.html [perma.cc/VNM2-X67L]. At-will employment means that the
employer does not enter into a contractual agreement with their employees,
and that there does not have to be good cause to fire any employees. Id.

vacation time, benefits, probationary periods, and performance reviews. Id.

of the agreement.117 This includes reimbursements, renegotiation
terms, and any bonuses for which the employee may be eligible.118
A termination clause is one of the most important clauses for
an employee. This states why an employer would be able to terminate an employee (for example, for cause, or limited circumstances
where no cause is needed), and any requirements of a recently
terminated employee (for example, returning company property,
documents, or secrets).119
A noncompete clause demands that the employee, should they
part ways with the employer, not practice their craft in competition
with the current employer either within a certain period of time,
within a certain geographical region, or a combination of both.120 It
may also state that a recently terminated employee is not allowed to
hire current employees, or solicit current clients of the employer.121
A choice of laws provision will declare which state laws
will govern the contractual agreement, and usually specifies in
which venue any suit the recently dismissed employee will be
required to file.122
The employee indicates via the option for counsel clause that
he or she had the opportunity to have their counsel review the
terms of the agreement, did have their counsel review the agreement, or agreed despite not having independent counsel review it
before signing.123
To avoid any conflicting testimonies about outside promises
and agreements, a statement agreeing that the four corners of the
contractual document state the full and final agreement between
the parties allows both employee and employer to use the contract
as official evidence of a complete and final agreement.124
Instead of allowing for an opportunity for the court to find
the entire contract unenforceable, a severability clause provides
that both employee and employer agree that if any clause may be
found to be unenforceable, that does not affect any other clauses
in the contract.125 This usually involves noncompete clauses that
are too aggressive or any other oppressive clauses originating with
the employer.

All of these clauses are intended to protect the rights of the
employer; the degree to which they do so can be negotiated by the
employee to their benefit. The point of the employment contract
is to fully outline the (usually) long-term relationship between
employee and employer, usually occurring between the hours of
9am and 5pm.126
2.

Entertainment Contracts

Entertainment contracts fulfill the special needs of the Industry by providing for the various terms of the job in writing. Two of
the most uniquely contracted for sections of the Industry are the
music and film marketplaces. While some music and film contracts
also include nondisclosure clauses (NDAs) in addition to the foregoing terms, there are advantages and disadvantages to this method,
and many times NDAs are separate agreements.127 Therefore, this
Subpart will only discuss what makes music and film contracts
unique, and NDAs will be discussed in Subpart III.B.2.
a. Music
The music industry is incredibly volatile. Recording artists sometimes do not live up to the hype created, and instead of
becoming stars, they end up as one-hit wonders. As a result, the
music industry is strict in making and enforcing their recording
agreements, as good albums pay for bad. A standard recording
contract includes recording obligations, a charge-back clause, an
overcall album provision, a license restriction term, a noncompete
clause, compensation agreement, payment schedule, record label’s
distribution rights, domestic sales clause, international royalties
provision, mutual covenants, artist’s originality warranties, hold
harmless agreements, assignments of rights, purchase of retail by
the artist clause, songwriter and publisher royalties, and an entire
agreement clause.128

Some standard recording obligations include the artist fully
funding the first project of at least five songs; any and all advances given to the artist will be charged to their revenue account
because, “[t]here are absolutely no ‘free rides’ in the music business, not even at the major label level. All costs are recoupable by
the company.”129
A charge-back clause states the amount the company will
cover, and what the artist will be charged on the other side of a successful album.130
An overcall album clause states that any artist that receives
an offer from a major label that makes over $1,000,000 in a calendar year after the expiration of the contract terms will be required
to record that album for the company.131
A license restriction clause limits the artists’ ability to license
their identity as a whole or in part for another record label’s project and profit.132
The recording contract noncompete requires that the artist not
record anything that sounds similar to, or is the same as something
they recorded for the company under this contract.133 The company
must have the album out within nine months of the agreement.134
The compensation provision outlines how and where the artist will be paid for their album success.135
The payment schedule clause is self-explanatory; it outlines
when the artist will be paid; the standard option is “72 hours prior
to the [recording] session being called.”136 This differs drastically
from the standard employment contract where employees are paid

attempting to claim copyright in Fogerty’s voice and writing style. The court believed that to be ludicrous, and even awarded Fogerty attorney’s fees for having
to defend such an action. Fogerty v. Fantasy Inc., 510 U.S. 517 (1994).

on an agreed-upon schedule ranging from once a week, semimonthly, or 26 times a year (every other week), almost always after the
work has been completed and not before.
The record label’s distribution rights provision lays out the
rights retained by the label. The standard distribution rights clause
allows the label to retain most of the manufacture, distribution,
and sale of tangible products created by the artist through various mediums.137
The domestic sales clause provides for the percentage to
which the artist is entitled, per a specific time period, and the terms
for that percentage.138
International royalties provisions outline what the artist is
due for sales or airplay outside the domestic United States: standard is 50 percent.139
A mutual covenant between the artist and the record label
includes the agreement to jointly choose songs to add to the current
album, and that the record label and producers will have the exclusive right to the music.140
Artist’s originality warranties promise that the artist is providing his or her original work and that the artist has the only right
to perform and record the music.141
Hold harmless agreements provide that the record label
makes no promises on the success of any of the artist’s albums, and
forces the artist to promise that neither they, nor their family, is
risking their livelihood to make the artist successful under these
contract terms.142 In practice, this is the struggling artist who is desperate for success and signs any agreement presented, including the

stipulation that they will not be in financial ruin if success does not
come their way.143
The assignment of rights clause states that at any time the
current record company can and may assign their rights under the
contract to any other record label.144
A purchase of retail merchandise by the artist provision states
how the artist can order their retail, by how many units, and how
much it will cost (usually artists can purchase their merchandise
“at cost”).145
Songwriter and publisher royalties state how much and under
what circumstances the artist will owe royalties to the songwriter
(or those who contracted for songwriting credit) and publisher (this
is usually after 15,000 albums have sold).146
The entire agreement clause is the same as those in the standard employment agreement; the entire agreement is stated within
the four corners of the document to simplify evidence of the official agreement.147
The recording contract is one of the most in-depth and strict
contracts in the Industry, heavily protecting the record label at the
expense of the artist. The relationship between the recording artist
and the record label is a long-term, several album agreement, usually. This means the contract that is signed before the relationship
begins will govern the relationship for several years. Interestingly, at any point the record label can leave the relationship under
the “assignment clause” while the artist remains tethered to the
agreement until they fully perform the agreed upon number of
albums—or prove they are an Industry “flop” and are required to
pay the label back under the “charge-back” clause. This agreement
essentially signs over the artist’s soul: their identity, their unique
sound, and their freedom to contract until the requisite number of
albums have been produced.
b. Film
The film industry encompasses several different types of jobs,
but for the purposes of this Article, the focus will be on examining
an actor’s contract. An actor’s contract includes several provisions

that both pertain to the Industry and traditional employment. A
standard actor’s contract includes a statement of the entire agreement, indication of company working with the actor (the “company
clause”), the artist’s agreed-upon credits or information, the actor’s
agent’s information, the film’s information, the stated role for
the actor, a nudity clause, any physical requirements of the actor,
location and duration statement, period of agreement, service
descriptions, remuneration clause, general fee terms, payments
schedule, and any agreed-upon special conditions.148
The statement of agreement is similar to those within other
employment contracts, as it states that what is included within the
four corners of the contract is the full and final agreement between
the parties.149
The company clause states which film company is producing the film.150 It lists the name of the company, the address, the
professional numbers, the telephone and fax information, and
email address.151
The artist’s clause lists the actor’s legal name, stage name,
agreed-upon screen credit (which name will be in the film credits),
the actor’s address and other contact information.152
The artist’s agent provision states who the actor’s agent is,
their contact information, and that the actor is exclusively contracted with the agent for any and all business and tax purposes.153
The film clause states the working title of the project and any
format that the project will take.154
The part in film clause states the agreed-upon casted role for
the actor, any details about the character necessary for the contract,
the wardrobe descriptions and requirements, the wardrobe provider (usually by the film company), and the value of the wardrobe.155
A nudity clause states any nudity requirements or simulated
sex acts required of the actor; including the “extent and nature” and
any part of the script where nudity or simulated sex occurs.156
A physical requirements clause states any requirements of
the actor by the film company, meaning any stunts, or physical

appearance (i.e., body composition, hair color, eye color, etc.) needs
for any particular parts of the script.157
The location and duration clause lays out where the film will
be shot, and how long the actor is required to be at the location.158
This may require several different locations for various terms.
The period of agreement clause will state the beginning of the
obligation to the film company and the date when the obligation
will terminate.159
The service description clause states when the actor will be
required on set and when the actor will be unavailable to shoot,
rehearse, be present for reshoots, or otherwise meet commitments.160
The remuneration clause lays out how the actor will be paid, if
they are to be paid per call (shoot), and taxable versus nontaxable
remuneration, including minimums and percentages owed.161
A general fees clause determines what fees are paid to the
actor in addition to previously agreed-upon compensation. General fees often include: rehearsal fees, narration fees, standby fees,
extra scene fees, per diems, travel expenses, wardrobe fees, location
accommodations, and fees for rest areas.162
The payments schedule clause states when the payments that
are due to the actor will be disbursed (this schedule may be “weekly on Friday’s in arrears,” “monthly on the last day of the month in
arrears,” or some other option).163
Lastly, a special conditions clause lays out any special circumstances that either party needs to be aware of before entering into
the agreement, specifically the protocol for any interference with
payment of fees.164
Due to the nature of the relationship, the film contract focuses
on the duties the actor must perform, not the rights of the employer. This is because the film contract is centered on a different
atmosphere. More specifically, an actor on a film project is entering
into a very short-term relationship with their film company; most
shoots last between six and eight weeks.165 It is also a much more
intensive work relationship, with shifts lasting roughly 13 hours a

the actor’s ability to perform the provided material and potentially
adjust their physical appearance as required—otherwise the actor is
already in breach of their employment contract and the agreement
may be void. For example, if Hugh Jackman had refused to lose the
weight necessary to adequately bring Jean Valjean (Les Miserables)
to life, he may have rendered his contract void and could have been
replaced (ignoring the potential voidability of Russell Crowe’s contract for that performance).
B.

The Differences Between Entertainment Contracts and Other
Employment Contracts

While entertainment contracts can be categorized as employment contracts, there are obvious differences between these two
forms. First, the employment atmosphere is different. Whereas
an employment contract generally refers to a corporate, 9am to
5pm, Monday through Friday job, an entertainment contract generally refers to different locations, strange hours, and sometimes,
dangerous situations. Second, the use of the nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is different in a regular employment contract than it
is sometimes used in an entertainment contract. This Subpart will
deal with these two differences.
1.

The Entertainment Employment Atmosphere

While America may refer to New York City as the “City that
Never Sleeps,” due to its nocturnal energy and activity, Hollywood,
California, can give it a run for its money. According to Haskell Wexler, a cameraman in the warehouses in Burbank, the entertainment
industry routinely works “[Seventy-plus-] hour weeks.”167 Wexler
confesses that the Industry sometimes forces artists and staff alike
into late nights, early mornings and strange locations.168 Shoots at
2am in dark rooms, men in women’s dressing rooms, nude shots, and
simulated sex scenes make the work relationship between coworkers and supervisors (directors and producers) blurred in relation to
the norm.169 In fact, “More than one-third (35%) of respondents

say they have been asked to hold work activities or meetings in
inappropriate environments such as hotel rooms or bedrooms.”170
This culture of abnormal work hours and strange work relationships foster opportunities for sexual harassment and assault.
2.

The Nondisclosure Agreement

Many industries employ the nondisclosure agreement (NDA)
to control the spread of confidential information to competitors, the
media, or other harmful receivers. In the Industry, however, NDAs
have been used in more nefarious ways. NDAs are commonly used
to protect the confidential pieces of the project, like the working
title, the cast members, scripts, and shooting locations.171 However,
many NDAs include provisions that deny entertainers the ability to
disclose information that takes place during the course of employment—and these provisions can and have been used to cover up
incidents of sexual assault.172 Here is one such provision: “The idenhttp://www.newsweek.com/old-hollywood-starlets-endured-sexual-harassment-weinstein-effect-710885 [https://perma.cc/C3UH-YUQ2] (“[O]n the set

phrase ensures that should something happen to an entertainer,
they are barred from disclosing that information to anyone outside
of the project.
Because the entertainer has agreed not to disclose any information about producers or staff, and any information regarding
that staff, if a sexual assault occurs, the entertainer has now agreed
that information concerning the assault is confidential. These types
of agreements have been protecting assailants for decades. In fact,
Harvey Weinstein has a long history of using NDAs as a way of
silencing his survivors.174 Other NDA-reliant individuals in the
Industry include: Val Kilmer, Herman Caine, Bill Cosby, Donald
Trump, Roger Ailes, and Bill O’Reilly.175
While many industries and markets use NDAs to protect their
intellectual property, trade secrets, or any other necessary information, the Industry has perverted the NDA into a way to protect
its sexual assailants by way of contract law. This is why there is

a need for more than just objectivity in entertainment contract
breach cases.

IV. Feminist Contract Theory as Applied to
Entertainment Contracts
The law is often construed as requiring a sense of objectivity
and emotionless analysis. But Feminist Contract Theory asks that
courts take into account the context of a breach of contract and use
a subjective analysis to understand social constraints and unequal
bargaining stances.176 The courts can do this in various ways, one of
which would be to use equitable defenses to protect the entertainer
from being held prisoner by their contract terms.
A.

Context and Subjectivity in the Law
Many legal scholars believe that the law, above all else, should
dispassionately and objectively review the facts around individuals
in a case as opposed to looking at a wider context.177 Objectivity supposedly aids in fostering fairness, and fairness is the goal of
the judicial system. However, applying feminist principles, theorists like Orit Gan and Catherine MacKinnon argue that contract
law fails to appropriately consider the context in which the contract
was created and fortified.178 According to Gan and MacKinnon, the
best way to ensure justice is to look at the entirety of the situation
around the creation and implementation of a contract, including
social constraints and the inequality of bargaining power.
Social constraints are expectations that require men and
women to act in a certain way. MacKinnon writes, “[w]hat the law
sees as consent is, in fact, women surrendering to power and succumbing to social constraints . . . because they have little choice
under social pressures.”179 Essentially, the argument is this: sometimes when women make less than ideal contracts, they do not enter
into them for themselves. Sometimes, women make contractual

obligations in consideration of others’ welfare.180 Struggling single
mothers of color make different decisions than powerful, successful white men. Gan argues, “rights-based analysis should take into
account the social constraints under which parties operate when
setting the baseline.”181
Because men and women experience power, sex, and contracts
differently, the inequality of bargaining power is an important factor to consider when analyzing contract negotiation and formation
between parties. Gan writes that “[w]hen there is a power disparity between the parties, they obviously do not negotiate on equal
footing.”182 Instead of looking at the contract on its face, the court
should look to whether or not the violated party was really in a
position to turn down the terms of the agreement, the consequences of such a rejection, and whether there was a true negotiation or
the imposition of forced contractual terms.183
B.

Remedies and Defenses

Even if courts do adopt a feminist legal theory of contract law,
entertainers who have survived sexual assault may still be faced
with breach-of-contract suits. For an entertainer and survivor of
sexual assault facing a breach-of-contract claim, there are several
defenses that lie on equitable grounds. These include: economic
duress, unconscionability, unclean hands, and unjust enrichment.
Duress occurs when someone commits a “wrongful act,”
which inhibits the other party from acting freely.184 This Article focuses on economic duress, which includes “one party us[ing]
economic threats to overcome another party’s will.”185 In Austin
Instrument, Inc. v. Loral Corporation, the Court of Appeals of New
York held that economic duress occurs when “one party to a contract has threatened to breach the agreement by withholding goods
unless the other party agrees to some further demand.”186 Traditional “duress doctrine ignores the context in which the contract
was written and ignores power imbalance between the parties.”187
Gan argues that there are three prongs to duress: “the illegitimate

behavior of the coercive party, the absence of free will of the
aggrieved party, and the unfairness of the contract.”188
In an entertainment contract situation, economic duress may
be obvious. To use the example of Kesha, Dr. Luke sexually assaulted her, and then attempted to force her to recant the accusations;
and to keep the abuse under wraps, Sony and Dr. Luke held her
contractual freedom, her livelihood, and her emotional health over
her head.189 Because Kesha’s economic livelihood depended on her
ability to release new music and tour, she was dependent on her
contract with Sony and Dr. Luke. By refusing to release her from it,
Sony and Dr. Luke forced Kesha to sacrifice her freedom and her
emotional health.
Unconscionability is another interesting defense available to
plaintiffs. Unconscionability can be employed when a court decides
that the contractual agreement is so “unfair under the circumstances as to be outrageous.”190 The court can void the entire contract,
remove the unconscionable portion, or diminish the clause so the
contract is no longer unconscionable.191
In Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., the Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that if there is an unreasonable
contract deemed to be unconscionable, “but not void for fraud, a
court of law will give to the party who sues for its breach damages . . . only such as he is equitably entitled to.”192 Essentially, in the
Industry, if an entertainer brought suit against their recording label
or film company for breach of contract for sexual assault—even if
all of the contractual provisions are not deemed to be fraudulent—
the court could look at the contract and make a determination
that it was being used unconscionably, and would award the entertainer breach damages for enduring sexual assault at the hands of
her employer.
In Lhotka v. Geographic Expeditions, Inc.,193 the California
Court of Appeals discussed the sliding scale of unconscionability.
The Lhotka Court posited that a sliding scale will be applied wherein “the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less
evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to conclude
that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.”194

In an entertainment contract situation, one must ask the court
to recognize that the entertainer is stuck in an abusive relationship
because of their contract terms. With unconscionability, by applying the Lhotka “sliding scale,” including the feminist approach of
context and subjectivity, and looking past the plain language of the
contract and into the situation holistically, courts can save many
entertainers from abusive situations stemming from their contractual obligations.
Another remedy is coercive equitable relief. Coercive equitable relief can take the form of any remedy that the court decides
to order in a lawsuit that does not include monetary damages,
but instead court-mandated action or inaction.195 One such equitable relief available is the unclean hands doctrine. The unclean
hands doctrine is an equitable concept that looks to the behavior
of the parties: if the party seeking relief has acted unjustly, then the
court does not reward them for that behavior.196 For instance, in
Green v. Higgins, the Kansas Supreme Court explained the unclean
hands doctrine as “he who comes into equity must come with clean
hands . . . no person can obtain affirmative relief in equity . . . in
which he has, himself, been guilty of inequitable conduct.”197
In the entertainment contract breach scenario, the unclean
hands doctrine could protect entertainers who are being abused,
forced to keep the secrets of their abusers via their NDAs, and
stuck in contractual arrangements that perpetuate their status as
victim. The court can use the unclean hands doctrine to recognize,
through feminist subjectivity and context, that the entertainer has
been abused, and that the abuser is an employee or the employer
(either directly or through vicarious liability); therefore, the record
label or film company bringing a contract breach suit into court
could be seen as entering with unclean hands because of the abuse
of the employee/entertainer. The unclean hands doctrine could,
for example, bar the DJ suing Taylor Swift from recovery since the
underlying issue in the suit was his sexual assault of her.
Another option for relief is restitution. “Restitution is the
remedy for unjust enrichment . . . . [U]njust enrichment is the substantive claim on which a request for restitution must be based.”198
Unjust enrichment occurs when the defendant gains an additional
benefit that was not contracted for and which damaged the plaintiff,

173

and where allowing the defendant to keep that benefit would be
unacceptable.199
In Chodos v. West Publishing Co., the 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals wrote: “[T]he measure of recovery . . . is the reasonable value of the services rendered, provided they were of direct
benefit to the defendant.”200 Therefore, if the defendant received
any additional services through the contractual relationship that
were not already compensated for, the correct way to resolve the
inequality is to tender the value of those services to the plaintiff, in
quantum meruit.
However, in the Industry, there is a problem with utilizing
restitution as a method of providing justice to abused entertainers.
If there are entertainers being abused and controlled through the
terms of their contract, how does one categorize and quantify the
abuse and control of entertainers as a benefit unjustly gained by
their abusers? Unjust enrichment may be a suitable legal concept
in theory, but the concern is that restitution will not be appropriate
under the circumstances.
One solution is to look to pain and suffering as a guide for
qualification and valuation, or to consider the contract completely unconscionable under the circumstances of abuse. As some, if
not all, abusers violate others to obtain power,201 they should be
compensated for their victimization, especially since they suffered
due to their contractual obligations to their abuser. Essentially, this
would look like Kesha winning a claim against Sony for her pain
and suffering while she worked with Dr. Luke, in an amount the
finder of fact determined her pain was worth.
C.

Damages

For breach of contract cases, there are two different types of
damages: compensatory and punitive.202 Compensatory damages
include general and special damages,203 and punitive damages are
used as a punishment and a deterrent.204

the rightful position, ideally by healing the damage caused by the

breacher’s wrongful actions and making the plaintiff whole.205 In
other words, they are meant to best approximate the plaintiff’s
financial loss or otherwise replicate their relative positions prebreach, or depending on the case, precontract.206
General damages reflect the direct impact of the breacher’s
actions, which caused the harm.207 “General damages for breach
by non-performance . . . [is] the fair market value . . . of [the promised service].”208 In the Industry, this may be what it would cost to
obtain another actor of the same caliber and/or notoriety to perform a specific role in a film.
Alternatively, special damages include all indirect loss
caused by contract breach other than those included in the general damages.209 Two types of special damages exist: reliance and
consequential.210
Reliance damages are any losses that arise from any preparation necessary for the contract to be fulfilled by the other party.211 In
the Industry, this might be any financial advances a record company
gives an artist, or any promotional advertisement a film company
creates in anticipation of an actor performing a role in a film.
Consequential damages are any other losses indirectly related
to the contractual breach by the breaching party.212 One example
of this within the Industry might be the loss of revenues from the
film without the name recognition of the actor who was originally cast in the role. There is clearly a difference in acting caliber
between Meryl Streep and Tara Reid for a role requiring an accomplished dramatic actress. The resulting loss of revenue from Tara
Reid playing the role Meryl Streep was intended for would be the
consequential damages Streep might be responsible for paying, if
she breaches her contract, necessitating the hiring of a suboptimal
replacement.
Another route is punitive damages. Punitive damages are used
as a way to punish and deter future breachers from breaching their
contracts in a similar fashion.213 There are three elements that courts
look to when considering punitive damages: degree of reprehensibility,

disparity of harm, and the punitive damages and civil penalties.214
This means courts need to decide how terribly the alleged abuser
acted against the survivor, how badly the survivor was abused, and
what remedies are available to the survivor via punitive damages or
already available civil penalties in other similar cases of abuse.
Generally, the most important piece of a punitive damages
analysis is the first prong, which looks at the actions of the breaching
party.215 Punitive damages may only be awarded when compensatory damages have also been awarded.216 One concern in the Industry
is that “the jury may not punish the defendant for conduct that
occurred outside of the state.”217 This is problematic because artists
travel internationally with their producers and others in supervisory roles routinely. It is part of their jobs to do so. This standard for
punitive damages allows the sexual assault of entertainers to fall
outside the likely reach of punitive damages if it occurs outside the
state in which the suit is brought.
Some may not see the issue with this, but consider this: if entertainers can sue both their assailant and the company as a whole
through vicarious liability, then punitive damages will be more readily available. As we have seen, there is a culture of sexual assault
in the Industry that is supported by the record labels and film companies by way of contract terms and NDAs.218 Therefore, punitive
damages towards these multibillion-dollar companies may actually
create a sea of change to combat sexual assault within the Industry.

for anything novel; they would simply seek equitable remedies for
entertainers who have been sexually abused by their coworkers,
supervisors, or others in positions of power. The problem, which is
not being addressed, is that there are entertainers who have been
assaulted and are then sued for breaching contracts by attempting
to leave their abusive work environments.220 Such situations victimize these entertainers twice: once by their assailants, and once more
by the judicial system.
Title VII mandates that employers have a duty to maintain
a safe work environment free from sexual assault and harassment.221 As record labels, film companies, and other entertainment
companies are essentially employers whose terms are stated in
employment contracts (although the entertainment contract does
differ from other employment contracts), these record labels and
film companies do have a contractual duty to maintain the Title VII
duty of care to their employees.
Sexual assault constitutes a breach of the employer’s duty to
maintain a safe work environment.222 Due to this, any sexual assault
committed against entertainers in the Industry becomes the first
breach of the employment contract with the company. Under this
analysis, any of Harvey Weinstein’s survivors would be able to sue
Miramax and be released of any of their contractual obligations
and relationships with the company. By recognizing that the film
company or record label has failed to satisfy their requirements
under Title VII, the court can find breach of the duty of care to
their employees.
Precedent holds that supervisor or coworker assault on
employees can attach vicarious liability to employers.223 Therefore,
entertainers who have been victimized by their direct supervisor
(say, a producer or director) can attach the film company or record
label to a suit for the assault as well. Any suit brought against the
assailant can therefore be brought against the company, which better enables the effective use of punitive damages, better incentivizes
a restructuring of sexual assault and harassment policies, and would
likely allow the entertainer to recover more damages overall.224

In a traditional breach of contract suit, defendants must prove
that they did not breach, or that in their breach they were really
survivors of assault. Under this analytical framework, entertainers have not been protected. Kesha sought injunctive relief so that
she would be able to record music with another label (other than
Kemosabe or any other Sony branch), but was denied.225 This ruling
and others like it force survivors of sexual assault to be responsible
for the damages awarded to plaintiffs in contract breach cases. In
the Kesha example, this would require Kesha to pay breach damages to Dr. Luke and Sony, when Dr. Luke abused her, and Sony
forced her to maintain that working relationship with him.226

Conclusion
The Industry is at a crossroads. With the exposure of serial
abusers like Harvey Weinstein, members of the Industry must make
a choice: change the culture, or continue to desensitize entertainers
and the American people to the abuse ingrained in the music, film,
and television markets.
The best way to prevent the continued victimization of entertainers is to create a culture within the Industry of respect and
reporting. Additionally, to reinforce this new culture, it is important to provide a means for judicial recourse when the safeguards
fail and entertainers are abused.
Title VII requires that employers must provide safe workplaces, free from sexual harassment and assault. When the workplace
becomes a breeding ground for sexual abuse, that duty has been
breached. Because the employer itself might not be meting out the
abuse, there may need to be a deeper analysis into who is committing these crimes. If it were a person in a supervisory capacity (like
a producer), then vicarious liability attaches, and the employer is
potentially liable for their representative’s tortious behavior.
Once it is determined that the employer breached the employment contract by allowing sexual assault to occur (or by protecting
the assailant after the fact), the entertainer now has the option to
sue to be released from the contract. There are many equitable
defenses the court might consider—economic duress, unconscionability, the unclean hands doctrine, or unjust enrichment—as a way
to facilitate the abused entertainers’ vindication of their Title VII

rights. One other option, however, is to find that once the employer’s supervisor breaches the contract by intentional sexual tort, the
contract is then voidable by the entertainer.
If the first breach is found by the court to have been committed by the employer instead of the departing entertainer, the court
can put the abusive employer/supervisor on the defensive during
the contract breach suit, and damages will be imposed against them
instead of against the entertainers.
Entertainers need to be protected. The rash of recently publicized sexual assaults in the Industry proves that there is
an institutional problem, and that there needs to be cultural and
institutional change. By allowing this exit strategy for abused
entertainers, courts can send a message to the Industry that abuse
will not be tolerated and the culture of sexual assault will no longer
be facilitated and protected.

intelligent thing I ever did is all boiled down to one dickhead
that did that to me.”227
